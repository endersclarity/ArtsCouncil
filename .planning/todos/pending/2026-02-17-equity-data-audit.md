## Problem

Culture Forward Champion scored Pillar 4 (Land, Culture, Stewardship) at 3/10. The platform has:
- Zero Indigenous representation (Washoe Tribe, Nevada City Rancheria Nisenan are key Culture Forward partners)
- Minimal Latino/a/x cultural visibility
- No underserved community focus
- No filters for "Family-Friendly," "Free Events," "Multilingual Spaces"

This is a DATA problem, not a design problem. The platform is built on 2019 ArcGIS data that didn't capture these voices. "The platform can only be as equitable as the data it's built on."

## Solution

Phase 5 (2027) work:

1. **Data audit** — Review 685 assets for representation. Are Indigenous cultural sites, Latino/a/x community spaces, and South County venues adequately surfaced?
2. **Community listening** — Partner with Washoe Tribe, Nevada City Rancheria Nisenan, and Latino/a/x community organizations to identify missing assets
3. **Category evolution** — Add filters for "Family-Friendly," "Free Events," "Youth Programs," "Multilingual Spaces"
4. **Content partnerships** — Co-create content with underserved communities rather than curating from outside
