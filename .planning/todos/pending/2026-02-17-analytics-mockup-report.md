## Problem

The synthesizer recommends a 3-minute analytics segment in tomorrow's demo. But analytics are already deployed (Umami, Phase 6/6.1) — the issue is the committee doesn't know what data looks like or why it matters. A visual mockup of a monthly intelligence report makes it concrete.

## Solution

Create a 1-page HTML or markdown mockup showing what a monthly demand signal report would look like:

- **Top 10 places by detail opens** (which venues get the most attention)
- **Category filter frequency** (what do visitors look for most)
- **Outbound click breakdown** (website, directions, phone — the "clicked through to a business" metric)
- **Itinerary engagement** (which trip plans get selected)
- **Zero-result searches** (what people expected to find but couldn't)
- **Device split** (mobile vs desktop — proves in-situ usage)

Use realistic-looking but synthetic data. The point isn't real numbers — it's showing the committee the KIND of intelligence they'd get.
