## Problem

Culture Forward Champion scored Pillar 2 (Learning, Skills, Career Pathways) at 2/10. The platform surfaces venues but not:
- Arts education programs
- Teaching artist opportunities
- Apprenticeships or internships
- Scholarships
- The Artist Accelerator program
- Business of Art workshops

Culture Forward has a 53-page Creative Career Pathways Plan projecting +21% job growth in motion picture/sound recording and +10.9% in arts/entertainment. The plan explicitly calls for a centralized "Arts Careers Portal linking jobs, internships, freelance contracts, and training opportunities." The platform has none of this.

## Solution

Phase 5 (2027) work:

1. **"Learn & Create" section** — New section on the platform surfacing:
   - Arts education programs (in-school and after-school)
   - Teaching artist opportunities
   - Artist Accelerator and Business of Art workshops
   - Scholarships and professional development
   - Internship and apprenticeship programs

2. **Category evolution** — Rename/expand "Community & Learning" (58 venues) to surface educational vs. community assets differently

3. **Data enrichment** — Tag existing 685 assets with education/career relevance where applicable

4. **Content partnership** — Work with Nevada County Superintendent of Schools, Sierra College, and Youth Commission to surface their programs
