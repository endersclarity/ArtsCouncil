## Problem

Base CSS conflicts with the magazine layout built by Codex. Inconsistent styling across sections where old design tokens clash with the new editorial aesthetic.

## Solution

Audit all CSS custom properties and class conflicts between the original base styles and the Codex magazine layout. Resolve conflicts in favor of the magazine direction.
