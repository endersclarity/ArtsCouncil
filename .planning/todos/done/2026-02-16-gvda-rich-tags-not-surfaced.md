title: GVDA rich tags not surfaced
area: events

## Problem

GVDA events have rich tags like Music/Concert, Children/Family, Beer/Wine/Food but the category dropdown only shows asset layer categories. These event-specific tags are available in the data but never exposed to users.

## Solution

Map GVDA event tags to the existing category dropdown or extend the dropdown with event-specific filter options. Need to define a mapping between GVDA tags and the 10 asset categories, or add a secondary "event type" filter.
