title: Event images fallback strategy
area: events

## Problem

100 events (all KVMR + all LibCal) have no images — they render as placeholder cards. The event carousel and list views look incomplete without visual content.

## Solution

Need a fallback image strategy. Options: category-based placeholder images, page scraping for event images from source sites, or a generic "community event" illustration set. Evaluate effort vs. impact for each approach.

## Research

Research: .planning/todo-research/events-ux-brief.md (Section 3) — ALREADY IMPLEMENTED
