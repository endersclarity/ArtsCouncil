## Problem

The local advocate's #1 ask: "What's happening tonight?" should be answerable in one tap, not by navigating to events and selecting a date filter. Current date chips (Today/Weekend/14d) exist but are buried in the events section. A local standing downtown at 6pm needs "Tonight" front and center.

## Solution

Add a prominent "Tonight" button/pill that:
1. Appears above the fold (hero area or sticky nav) — not buried in events section
2. One tap filters events to today after 5pm (or current time if after 5pm)
3. Shows count badge ("Tonight (4)")
4. Works on mobile as a primary CTA

Also add "This Weekend" as a similarly prominent quick filter.

These are the repeat-use hooks that bring locals back. The local advocate said: "Events-first is what would make me return weekly."
