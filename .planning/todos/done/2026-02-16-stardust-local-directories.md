## Problem

Stardust Station and other local creative directories have content that should be on the Arts Council page but isn't. Coverage gaps exist for local businesses and creative spaces.

## Solution

Reach out about API or submission form access. If their content exists online in a directory format, explore ingestion. Also get local creative feedback on coverage gaps in the current 687-asset dataset.
