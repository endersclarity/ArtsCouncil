## Problem

KVMR iCal feed has no category metadata. Events rely on weak keyword inference from titles. Many events end up uncategorized.

## Solution

Options: manual tagging of recurring KVMR events, better keyword inference rules based on title patterns, or accepting that KVMR events will be untagged and ensuring the UI handles that gracefully.
