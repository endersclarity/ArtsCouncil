## Problem

Family & Kids filter is currently a time-filter chip alongside All/Today/Weekend/2 Weeks. It's a different dimension — users should be able to combine "family + this weekend" but can't because they're mutually exclusive chips.

## Solution

Move Family & Kids to a separate dimension — either a checkbox or a category dropdown option — so it can be combined with any time range filter.
