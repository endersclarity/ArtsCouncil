## Problem

Committee presentation is Feb 18. The synthesizer and career strategist both recommend getting committee members on their phones during the demo. Without pre-built deep links, Kaelen would need to navigate live, which is slow and error-prone.

## Solution

Prepare a set of bookmarkable deep links that demonstrate key platform capabilities:

1. **Del Oro Theater** — `?place=Del+Oro+Theater` — shows detail panel with hours, events, directions
2. **Gold Rush Heritage Trail** — `?experience=gold-rush-heritage` — triggers cinematic corridor flyover
3. **A live event this week** — whatever's most compelling in the current Trumba feed
4. **Perfect Day itinerary** — `?itinerary=perfect-day` — shows 1-day trip plan
5. **Highway 49 corridor** — triggers cultural corridor mode
6. **Events filtered to "This Weekend"** — shows real-time event feed

Put these in a simple text file or bookmark set. Share the stitch-lab URL with committee members during demo.
