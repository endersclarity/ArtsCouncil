<objective>
Polish mobile responsive behavior at key viewport widths (375px, 390px, 768px) and reframe all user-facing copy from internal/government language to visitor-experience language. This is the final pass that makes the site feel intentional on phones and reads like a travel guide, not a data portal.

Purpose: Mobile is likely the primary access device for visitors. Copy reframing eliminates the last traces of "government listings site" and positions the platform as a travel publication. Together, these changes complete the Phase 1 visual refresh.

Output: Mobile-ready CSS at all breakpoints, visitor-facing copy throughout the HTML

  <name>Task 1: Mobile responsive polish pass at 375px/390px/768px</name>
  <files>website/cultural-map-redesign/index-maplibre.css, website/cultural-map-redesign/index-maplibre-hero-intent.css</files>
  <action>
Test and fix responsive behavior at three key viewports. Use the EXISTING four breakpoints (600px, 760px, 900px, 980px) — do NOT add new ones.

**At 375px (iPhone SE — smallest target):**
- Hero: Mast bar text should not overflow. If `.mast-name` text is too long, ensure `font-size: clamp()` scales down. Discovery tabs should stack or scroll horizontally (not wrap into overlapping rows).
- Cards: All cards must be single-column, full-width. No two-column grids at this width.
- Map: Map should be full-width with minimal padding. Map controls should be reachable (not hidden behind other elements).
- Detail panel: Should be full-screen overlay, not squeezed sidebar.
- Events carousel: Cards should scroll horizontally or stack vertically — no overflow hidden cutting off content.
- Typography: Body text minimum 14px for readability. Headings should scale appropriately.
- Touch targets: All tappable elements (pills, buttons, tabs) minimum 44px height.

**At 390px (iPhone 14 — common):**
- Same as 375px but verify no issues at this slightly wider width
- Tab labels should be fully readable

**At 768px (iPad — tablet):**
- Cards can be 2-column grid (not 3-column)
- Map and detail panel should coexist (map 60%, panel 40% if side-by-side, or panel as overlay)
- Hero tabs should display horizontally
- Generous whitespace between sections

**Specific fixes to look for:**
- Any `width` or `min-width` values that cause horizontal overflow at narrow widths
- Any `position: fixed` elements that overlap at small screens
- Any `font-size` values that don't use clamp() or responsive units and become too large on mobile
- Any `gap` values that create too much spacing on small screens
- Any images or maps that don't scale down properly

**In index-maplibre-hero-intent.css:**
- Check the existing `@media (max-width: 760px)` and `@media (max-width: 980px)` blocks
- Verify they work with the new editorial token styles from Plans 01-02
- Fix any conflicts where base CSS responsive rules fight with hero-intent responsive rules

**DO NOT:**
- Add new breakpoints
- Change existing grid/flex layouts at desktop widths
- Remove any existing responsive rules that work correctly
- Change class names
  </action>
  <verify>
Test in browser DevTools responsive mode:
1. At 375px: No horizontal scrollbar, no overlapping elements, all text readable, all cards full-width
2. At 390px: Same checks, no regressions
3. At 768px: Appropriate column count, no cramped layouts, tabs display horizontally
4. Between breakpoints (500px, 650px, 850px): No layout breaks at widths between breakpoints
5. All interactive elements have minimum 44px touch targets at mobile widths
  </verify>
  <done>
Mobile layout is functional and readable at 375px width without horizontal scroll or overlapping elements. Tablet layout uses appropriate column counts. No responsive regressions at any viewport width between 375px and 1440px.
  </done>

  <name>Task 2: Copy reframing pass — visitor-experience language everywhere</name>
  <files>website/cultural-map-redesign/index-maplibre-hero-intent.html</files>
  <action>
Reframe all user-facing copy in the HTML file. Preserve ALL `id`, `aria-*`, `data-*`, `role`, `tabindex`, `onclick`, and structural attributes — only change visible text content.

**Specific replacements:**

| Element | Current Text | New Text |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| `<title>` | "Cultural Asset Map" (or similar) | "Explore Nevada County" |
| `.mast-name` (h1) | "Cultural Asset Map" | "Explore Nevada County" |
| `.mast-sub` | "Nevada County Arts Council" | "Your guide to local culture" |
| `.hero-variant-sub` | "Explore Nevada County's cultural landscape..." | "Discover local galleries, dining, performances, and hidden gems" |
| Section tags like "Directory" | "Directory" | "Places to Explore" |
| Search placeholder | "Search" or generic | "Search places, events, experiences..." |
| Events filter "14d" label | "14d" | "2 Weeks" |
| Explore section heading | "Explore by Category" | "Explore by Category" (keep — this works) |
| Colophon "About This Project" | "About This Project" | "About This Guide" |
| Colophon "687 cultural assets across 10 categories" | Internal data-speak | "Over 680 places to discover across Nevada County" |
| Any "cultural assets" text | "cultural assets" | "places" or "local spots" |
| Any "Quiet Graphics" reference | Internal design reference | Remove or replace with "Crafted for the Experience Planning Committee" |

**Use working title "Explore Nevada County"** as the placeholder name. Per research, the name can be changed later without structural impact. It frames visitor intent well.

**Rules:**
- Never change `id` attributes — deep links depend on them
- Never change `aria-controls`, `aria-labelledby`, `role` — accessibility depends on them
- Never change `data-*` attributes — JS modules depend on them
- Only change text content inside elements, not the elements themselves
- Reframe around "What can I DO here?" not "What DATA exists?"
- If in doubt about a specific piece of text, lean toward the visitor-facing version

**Scan for any remaining internal language:**
- "asset(s)" → "place(s)" or "spot(s)"
- "layer" → "category" (if user-visible)
- "feature(s)" → "place(s)" or "destination(s)"
- "pipeline" → should not appear in user-facing text
- Nature-forward framing → redirect to cultural/downtown framing
  </action>
  <verify>
1. Grep the HTML file for internal language: `grep -in "cultural asset\|14d\|quiet graphics\|pipeline\|feature server" index-maplibre-hero-intent.html` — should return 0 matches
2. Verify `<title>` contains "Explore Nevada County"
3. Verify h1 (`.mast-name`) contains "Explore Nevada County"
4. Grep for preserved attributes: `grep -c 'id="' index-maplibre-hero-intent.html` — count should be same as before edit
5. Grep for preserved aria attributes: `grep -c 'aria-' index-maplibre-hero-intent.html` — count should be same as before edit
6. Load site and verify all deep links still work (?pid=, ?muse=, etc.)
  </verify>
  <done>
All visible UI copy references visitor experiences and local businesses. No internal language ("cultural assets", "14d", "quiet graphics") remains in user-facing text. All structural attributes (id, aria-*, data-*, role) are preserved for deep linking and accessibility.
  </done>
</task>

<verification>
1. Load the hero-intent variant at 375px — readable, no horizontal scroll, cards stack
2. Load at 768px — appropriate layout, not cramped
3. Read through all visible text — should read like a travel guide, not a data portal
4. Test deep links: ?pid=ChIJRY258Dtwm4ARmf8wS-mzAzA should still open Del Oro Theater detail
5. Screen reader: All aria-* attributes intact (check with browser DevTools accessibility inspector)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- 375px viewport: Zero horizontal scroll, all text readable, cards stacked
- 768px viewport: Appropriate column layout, generous whitespace
- Zero instances of "cultural asset", "14d", "quiet graphics", or other internal language in visible text
- All deep links functional
- All accessibility attributes preserved
- Page title and h1 say "Explore Nevada County"
