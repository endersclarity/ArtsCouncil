<objective>
Rewrite all user-facing text on the hub page and in the config JS, incorporating the specific editorial decisions settled by the writers' room. The writers' room resolved every open creative question — the executor implements those decisions, not makes new ones.

Purpose: The hub page is the primary surface visitors and committee members see. The writers' room produced definitive direction on hero headline, geographic context, register rules, and vocabulary. This plan executes those decisions precisely.

Output: Hub HTML and config.js with ~45 text strings rewritten per writers' room direction. Zero open creative questions for the executor.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Rewrite hub HTML copy — hero, mast, tabs, sections, MUSE cards, colophon</name>
  <files>website/cultural-map-redesign-stitch-lab/index-maplibre-hero-intent-stitch-frontend-design-pass.html</files>
  <action>
Read the full hub HTML. Rewrite every user-facing text string using the writers' room decisions below. The Copy Surface Inventory (IDs H1-H26 from 04-RESEARCH.md) is the checklist.

**SETTLED DECISIONS — implement exactly, do not deviate:**

**H1 — SEO title tag:**
Change `<title>Explore Nevada County — Frontend Design Pass</title>` to:
`<title>Explore Nevada County | Galleries, Events &amp; Dining in the Sierra Foothills</title>`
This is real SEO copy replacing a development artifact.

**H2 — Mast:**
Keep "Explore Nevada County" as mast for now (platform name decision deferred to 04-03).

**H3 — Edition tagline:**
Replace "Culture · Discovery · 2026" with "Issue 03 | 2026" (mirroring MUSE's own format). "Culture · Discovery · 2026" is dead — the writers' room killed it unanimously.

**H4 — Cover tag:**
Keep "Nevada County Cultural District" — this is the ONE permitted use of "Cultural District" in conversational copy (the other is in the colophon).

**H5 — Hero headline:**
Replace "Your Guide to Local Culture" with:
```
The Creative Life
```
Sub-line (new element or existing sub-line):
```
Grass Valley · Nevada City · Truckee · the Sierra foothills
```
This is the editor's Recommendation #1. Derived from Eliza Tudor's phrase "creative life in motion." "The" gives it editorial authority.

<!-- Alternative #2 (for committee consideration, do not implement): "Nevada County" with sub-line "Galleries, stages, vineyards, and 687 places across the Sierra foothills" -->
<!-- Alternative #3 (for committee consideration, do not implement): "Where the Gold Turned to Art" with sub-line "Grass Valley · Nevada City · the Sierra foothills" -->

**Geographic context line (NEW):**
Add a single factual line in the hero area, OUTSIDE the editorial voice:
```
60 miles from Sacramento · 2.5 hours from San Francisco · 45 minutes from Reno
```
This should be a small, quiet, functional element — tourists notice it, locals ignore it. Use a CSS class that makes it visually subordinate (small text, muted color). Place it below the hero sub-line or in the cover area.

**H6 — TOC kicker:**
Remove "start exploring" entirely. It's a verb invitation — Voice Rule 6 says cut these. If the layout needs something here, use a plain label or leave empty.

**H7 — TOC title:**
"Discover by Story" — cut or simplify. The editor ruled: "Don't announce what things are" (Rule 9). Replace with a plain noun or remove. If a label is needed, consider just removing this title entirely and letting the tabs speak for themselves.

**H8 — Tab labels:**
Plain nouns only (Voice Rule 6). Current labels: "Categories," "Feature Picks," "Upcoming Events," "Curated Routes."
- "Categories" — keep (functional, fine)
- "Feature Picks" — keep or simplify to "Picks" (Claude's discretion)
- "Upcoming Events" — keep or simplify to "Events" (Claude's discretion)
- "Curated Routes" — simplify to "Routes" (remove the adjective)
No verbs. No invitations. No "Discover by..." framing.

**H9 — Browse categories pane label:**
"Browse categories" — the verb "Browse" is borderline. Simplify to just "Categories" or remove the redundant label since the tab already says "Categories."

**H10 — TOC note:**
"Interactive · Updated weekly" — remove entirely. Rule 9: never explain the mechanism. The map being interactive is self-evident. The update cadence is metadata, not editorial.

**H11 — Map panel title:**
"Cultural Asset Map" becomes "Interactive Map" or simply "Map." NOT "Cultural District Map" — the editor explicitly ruled against putting "Cultural District" in conversational copy beyond the cover tag and colophon.

**H12 — Map pill:**
"687 places" — keep as-is. Already correct.

**H13 — Map active text:**
"assets" in all instances becomes "places." This is handled in config.js (Task 2) but verify the HTML doesn't have any hardcoded "assets" strings.

**H14 — Featured Narratives section header:**
Keep "Featured Narratives" or simplify. It's lightly editorial but legible. Claude's discretion.

**H15 — Editorial eyebrow:**
"from MUSE '26 | Issue 03" — keep as-is. This is factual attribution, not jargon.

**H16 — Upcoming Events section header:**
Keep "Upcoming Events" — functional and fine.

**H17 — Events title:**
"Now and next" — the editor flagged this as trying too hard. Replace with "Events" or "What's On" — something immediately legible.

**H18 — Map addon header:**
"Guided Routes & Experiences" — simplify. "Routes & Experiences" or just "Routes." Drop "Guided" (it's explaining the mechanism).

**H19 — Corridor addon:**
"Cultural Corridors from MUSE '26" — the tourist flagged this as insider shorthand. Simplify to "Heritage Corridors" or "Highway Routes." Drop the MUSE attribution from the label (it can live in the description).

**H20 — Curated Experiences:**
"Curated Experiences" — simplify to "Experiences." Drop the adjective.

**H21 — MUSE section title:**
"MUSE stories, mapped." — the editor ruled this over-explains (Rule 9). Replace with something that provides context for visitors who don't know MUSE. One-liner: "From MUSE, the Cultural District's print journal" or "From the pages of MUSE magazine." The section title itself can just be "MUSE" or "From MUSE."

**H22 — MUSE section subtitle:**
Rewrite to provide one sentence of context for visitors: what MUSE is, why it matters. Example: "Feature stories from MUSE, the Nevada County Arts Council's print journal — now mapped to the places they describe." This is the MUSE framing the editor called for.

**H23 — MUSE cards:**
Keep existing MUSE card quotes, titles, and author lines if they are already sourced from actual MUSE content. Verify they use place-first, second-person, active voice. Rewrite only if they are placeholder text.

**H24 — Directory header:**
"Directory" tag + "Explore by Category" heading. The tag is fine. "Explore by Category" uses a verb — simplify to "By Category" or just remove the sub-heading and let the directory speak for itself.

**H25 — Colophon:**
Rewrite to mirror MUSE's credit pattern. Three notes:

Note 1 — Places:
"687 places across Nevada County's two California Cultural Districts. Created by the Experience Planning Committee and Nevada County Arts Council."
(Use "Created by" not "Crafted for." Name the committee. Use "Cultural Districts" — this is the colophon, one of two permitted uses.)

Note 2 — Editorial:
"Editorial content adapted from MUSE, published by Nevada County Arts Council."

Note 3 — Built with:
Keep technical credits as-is.

Remove: "sourced from" (passive). Remove: "Last updated December 2024" (reads like a government portal). Remove any "Crafted for" language.

**H26 — Footer:**
Keep "© 2026 Nevada County Arts Council."

**VOICE RULES (apply across all edits):**
- Rule 1: Name before noun (proper name first)
- Rule 2: Second-person "you" (never "visitors" or "tourists")
- Rule 3: Earned adjectives only
- Rule 6: Functional surfaces stay functional — tab labels = plain nouns
- Rule 9: Never explain the mechanism — trust content to speak
- Rule 10: Specificity test — could this describe any town? If yes, rewrite with Nevada County specifics.

**BANNED PHRASES:** "hidden gem," "best-kept secret," "off the beaten path," "must-see," "bucket list," "nestled in," "escape the ordinary," "discover the magic," "cultural asset(s)."

Grep the modified HTML for: "cultural asset" (should return 0 hits), "hidden gem" (0), "best-kept secret" (0), "Culture · Discovery" (0), "Frontend Design Pass" (0), "start exploring" (0). Grep for "The Creative Life" (should appear in hero). Grep for "Experience Planning Committee" (should appear in colophon). Grep for "Issue 03 | 2026" (should appear). Grep for "Sacramento" or "San Francisco" (should appear in geographic context line). Confirm "Cultural District" appears exactly twice: once in cover tag, once in colophon.
  </verify>
  <done>
All 26 hub HTML copy surfaces rewritten per writers' room decisions. Hero headline is "The Creative Life" with town sub-line. Geographic context line added with drive times. "Cultural District" appears exactly in cover tag + colophon. Edition tagline is "Issue 03 | 2026." SEO title is real copy. MUSE section has visitor context. All tabs are plain nouns. Zero "cultural assets" in user-facing text.

  <name>Task 2: Rewrite config.js — category names, demo pick taglines, venue terminology</name>
  <files>website/cultural-map-redesign-stitch-lab/index-maplibre-config.js</files>
  <action>
Read the full config.js. Rewrite all user-facing strings in the CATS object, DEMO_FEATURED_PICKS, and mapActiveText.

**Category names (CATS object):**
Per research, rename only "Cultural Resources" — the other 9 are MUSE-aligned. First, check what venues actually fall in the "Cultural Resources" category by grepping data.json for that layer. Based on findings:
- If mostly libraries/archives: rename to "Libraries & Archives"
- If broader (schools, media, community orgs): rename to "Community & Learning"
- Keep all other 9 category names as-is

**Category short names:**
Update the corresponding short name for the renamed category.

**DEMO_FEATURED_PICKS taglines (C3):**
Rewrite all 8 demo pick taglines in MUSE editorial voice:
- Place-first (use the actual venue/event name)
- Second-person hook ("you'll find," "don't miss")
- Sensory or characterizing detail
- Short (one line, ~10-15 words)
- Apply Rule 10 specificity test: could this tagline describe a pick in any town? If yes, add a Nevada County-specific detail.

**mapActiveText and related strings:**
- Change any instance of "assets" to "places" in user-facing config strings
- "687 assets" -> "687 places"
- Any filter/search placeholder text: "Search places" not "Search assets"
- Map panel title string if it lives in config: "Interactive Map" or "Map" (not "Cultural Asset Map")

**Do NOT change:**
- Internal variable names (keep `assets` in code identifiers)
- JSON key names
- Color definitions
- Numeric constants
  </action>
  <verify>
Grep config.js for the string "asset" in user-facing text contexts (mapActiveText, labels, descriptions). Should find 0 user-facing instances. Grep for renamed category to confirm it appears.
  </verify>
  <done>
Config.js category names MUSE-aligned (Cultural Resources renamed based on data inspection). All 8 demo pick taglines rewritten in MUSE editorial voice with specificity test applied. mapActiveText says "places" not "assets." Map panel title string updated. No user-facing "cultural assets" language.
  </done>

<success_criteria>
Hub page reads as an Experience Planning Committee editorial publication with every writers' room decision implemented. Hero headline is "The Creative Life." Geographic context serves tourists without patronizing locals. "Cultural District" is used precisely, not casually. All tabs and labels are clean functional nouns. The MUSE section is accessible to visitors who don't know the magazine. Zero instances of "cultural assets," nature-first framing, or generic tourism cliches.
