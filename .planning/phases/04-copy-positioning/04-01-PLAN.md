<objective>
Rewrite all user-facing text on the hub page and in the config JS to align with the MUSE magazine voice. This covers the hero headline, mast branding, tab labels, section headers, map panel labels, MUSE editorial cards, colophon, footer, category names, and demo pick taglines.

Purpose: The hub page is the primary surface visitors and committee members see. Every string must read as the Experience Planning Committee's editorial-quality digital tool, with downtown/culture-forward positioning derived from MUSE voice analysis.

Output: Hub HTML and config.js with ~45 text strings rewritten in MUSE voice (editorial register for narrative sections, functional register for labels/UI).

  <name>Task 1: Rewrite hub HTML copy — hero, mast, tabs, sections, MUSE cards, colophon</name>
  <files>website/cultural-map-redesign-stitch-lab/index-maplibre-hero-intent-stitch-frontend-design-pass.html</files>
  <action>
Read the full hub HTML. Rewrite every user-facing text string using the MUSE Voice Rules from 04-RESEARCH.md. Use the Copy Surface Inventory (IDs H1-H26) as a checklist.

**MUSE Voice Rules (apply to every edit):**
- Place-first introductions (proper name before category)
- Second-person direct address ("you" not "visitors")
- Em-dash parenthetical color for vivid detail
- Short punchy closers
- MUSE vocabulary DNA: "places" not "assets," "creative life" not "arts scene," "cultural district" not "area," specific proper nouns always
- Never use: "hidden gem," "best-kept secret," "off the beaten path," "must-see," "bucket list"
- Active voice: "You will find" not "Can be found"

**Register assignment (from research):**
- EDITORIAL (warm, narrative, second-person): Hero headline (H5), edition tagline (H3), MUSE section title/subtitle (H21-H22), MUSE card content (H23), colophon notes (H25)
- FUNCTIONAL (clean, direct, minimal): Title tag (H1), mast (H2), cover tag (H4), tab labels (H8), pane labels (H6, H9), toc note (H10), map panel title (H11), map pill (H12), active text (H13), section headers (H14-H20), directory header (H24), footer (H26)

**Specific edits:**
- H1: Change title to remove "Frontend Design Pass" — use platform name
- H2: Keep "Explore Nevada County" as mast for now (platform name decision deferred to 04-03)
- H3: Rewrite edition tagline in MUSE voice (not generic "Culture * Discovery * 2026")
- H4: Keep "Nevada County Cultural District" (matches MUSE's own framing)
- H5: Rewrite hero headline — MUST lead with cultural venues/activities, NOT nature. Use MUSE's own approach: evocative, specific, short. Options from research: "Nevada County Cultural District," "Creative Life in Motion," "Discover What We Make." Pick the one that best captures the core promise per MUSE analysis.
- H6-H10: Clean functional labels. "start exploring" -> simpler. Tab labels: keep or sharpen.
- H11: "Cultural Asset Map" -> "Cultural District Map" or just "Map"
- H12: "687 places" (already correct)
- H13: "assets" -> "places" everywhere in mapActiveText
- H14-H20: Section headers — keep functional but align with MUSE vocabulary
- H21-H22: MUSE section title/subtitle — editorial register, evocative
- H23: MUSE card titles, quotes, author lines — verify they are actual MUSE quotes (these should stay as-is if already sourced from MUSE; rewrite if placeholder)
- H24: Directory header — functional register
- H25: Colophon — rewrite to mirror MUSE's credit pattern:
  1. "687 places across Nevada County's two California Cultural Districts"
  2. "Curated by the Experience Planning Committee and Nevada County Arts Council"
  3. "Editorial content adapted from MUSE, published by Nevada County Arts Council"
  4. Technical credits as-is
- H26: Footer copyright — "2026 Nevada County Arts Council" (keep)

**Geography rule:** "Nevada County Cultural District" as umbrella brand. Individual town names (Grass Valley, Nevada City, Penn Valley) when describing specific areas.
  </action>
  <verify>
Grep the modified HTML for: "cultural asset" (should return 0 hits), "hidden gem" (0), "best-kept secret" (0), "off the beaten path" (0). Grep for "Experience Planning Committee" (should appear in colophon). Grep for "places" in map panel area (should appear).
  </verify>
  <done>
All 26 hub HTML copy surfaces (H1-H26) rewritten. Hero headline leads with culture/downtown. Colophon credits Experience Planning Committee. No "cultural assets" in user-facing text. Editorial sections use warm MUSE register. Functional sections use clean direct register.

  <name>Task 2: Rewrite config.js — category names, demo pick taglines, venue terminology</name>
  <files>website/cultural-map-redesign-stitch-lab/index-maplibre-config.js</files>
  <action>
Read the full config.js. Rewrite all user-facing strings in the CATS object, DEMO_FEATURED_PICKS, and mapActiveText.

**Category names (CATS object):**
Per research, rename only "Cultural Resources" — the other 9 are MUSE-aligned. First, check what venues actually fall in the "Cultural Resources" category by grepping data.json for that layer. Based on findings:
- If mostly libraries/archives: rename to "Libraries & Archives"
- If broader (schools, media, community orgs): rename to "Community & Learning"
- Keep all other 9 category names as-is

**Category short names:**
Update the corresponding short name for the renamed category.

**DEMO_FEATURED_PICKS taglines (C3):**
Rewrite all 8 demo pick taglines in MUSE editorial voice:
- Place-first (use the actual venue/event name)
- Second-person hook ("you'll find," "don't miss")
- Sensory or characterizing detail
- Short (one line, ~10-15 words)

**mapActiveText and related strings:**
- Change any instance of "assets" to "places" in user-facing config strings
- "687 assets" -> "687 places"
- Any filter/search placeholder text: "Search places" not "Search assets"

**Do NOT change:**
- Internal variable names (keep `assets` in code identifiers)
- JSON key names
- Color definitions
- Numeric constants
  </action>
  <verify>
Grep config.js for the string "asset" in user-facing text contexts (mapActiveText, labels, descriptions). Should find 0 user-facing instances. Grep for renamed category to confirm it appears.
  </verify>
  <done>
Config.js category names MUSE-aligned (Cultural Resources renamed based on data inspection). All 8 demo pick taglines rewritten in MUSE editorial voice. mapActiveText says "places" not "assets." No user-facing "cultural assets" language.
  </done>
</task>

1. Open hub HTML in browser — hero headline references culture/downtown, not nature
2. Colophon section credits Experience Planning Committee
3. Map panel says "places" not "assets"
4. Category filter shows MUSE-aligned names
5. `grep -i "cultural asset" hub.html config.js` returns 0 matches
6. `grep -i "hidden gem\|best-kept secret\|off the beaten path\|must-see\|bucket list" hub.html` returns 0
7. MUSE editorial cards use place-first, active voice
</verification>

<success_criteria>
Hub page reads as an Experience Planning Committee editorial publication. Every visible string uses MUSE-derived voice — editorial register for narrative content, functional register for UI elements. Zero instances of "cultural assets," nature-first framing, or generic tourism cliches.
