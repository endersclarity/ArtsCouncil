<objective>
Rewrite all narrative text in itineraries.json and experiences.json using the MUSE magazine voice, incorporating specific writers' room decisions on register, transitions, and specificity. This is the bulk creative writing work of the phase — ~80 text blocks.

Purpose: Itinerary and experience narratives are the platform's most editorial-facing content. The writers' room settled that these surfaces get full MUSE voice (editorial register) while tips stay functional. The editor's priority order places itinerary narratives at #8 and experience descriptions at #9 — important but not as critical as the hub page changes in Plan 01.

Output: Fully rewritten itineraries.json (~50 blocks) and experiences.json (~30 blocks) in MUSE voice with writers' room specificity requirements baked in.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Rewrite itineraries.json — titles, descriptions, stop narratives, tips</name>
  <files>website/cultural-map-redesign-stitch-lab/itineraries.json</files>
  <action>
Read the full itineraries.json. Rewrite every text field using the writers' room decisions below.

**SETTLED DECISIONS from the writers' room:**

**Voice rules for narratives (editorial register):**
- Rule 1: Name before noun — always lead with the proper place name. "California Organics pairs a rotating farm-to-table menu with gallery walls" not "Settle into a farm-to-table lunch at one of Nevada City's most beloved spots."
- Rule 2: Second-person "you" — address the reader directly. "You'll find it hard to leave" not "Visitors will enjoy."
- Rule 3: Earned adjectives — every descriptive word backed by a specific. Not "charming gallery" but "The Granucci Gallery at The Center for the Arts."
- Rule 4: Short punchy closers — end paragraphs with a short declarative sentence. "We're still lucky." "The gold is gone. What replaced it is better."
- Rule 5: Em-dash parenthetical color — insert vivid detail with em-dashes.
- Rule 10: Specificity test — after writing each narrative, test: could this describe any town? If yes, rewrite with a proper noun, specific detail, or fact unique to Nevada County.

**BANNED TRANSITIONS (editor's explicit call, item #8):**
Cut these generic transitions entirely: "Settle into," "Wind down with," "Stretch your legs," "Ease into your day," "Cap off the evening." MUSE doesn't ease you into things — it walks you down a specific street and points at a specific door.

Replace with directional, physical, specific transitions: "Walk further down Main Street," "Cross the bridge to Nevada City," "The parking lot behind the Holbrooke puts you two blocks from..."

**Rewrite pattern (from research Example 4):**
Before: "Settle into a farm-to-table lunch at one of Nevada City's most beloved spots."
After: "California Organics pairs a rotating farm-to-table menu with gallery walls that change as often as the seasons. Grab the back patio in warm weather — you'll find it hard to leave."

**Structure (per itinerary):**
- J1 - Title: Short, evocative, culture-forward. Reference what you DO (galleries, dining, performances) not where you ARE (foothills, mountains). The local perspective flagged "Arts & Nature: A Perfect Day" as tourist-oriented — keep the itinerary's content but make the title culturally specific rather than generic.
- J2 - Subtitle: One-line positioning in editorial register.
- J3 - Description: 2-3 sentences, sets the tone, mentions key cultural stops by name. Must include at least one specific proper noun.
- J4 - Stop narratives (~7 per itinerary): Each 2-3 sentences. Name first, then sensory hook, then second-person invitation. Vary sentence length. Use em-dashes. Every narrative must name the venue in the first 3-5 words.
- J5 - Stop tips: FUNCTIONAL register only. Actionable, specific, no narrative. "Free parking on Broad Street. Open 10-5 weekdays." NOT "You'll love the charming parking." No "Settle into" or "Wind down" in tips either.

**Culture-forward rule:** Every itinerary title and description must lead with galleries, dining, performances, studios. Trails/nature mentioned ONLY as connecting tissue between cultural stops or scenic backdrop.

**Truckee rule:** Do NOT add Truckee content to itineraries. The hero sub-line includes Truckee (Plan 01) but the executor should not fabricate Truckee stops that don't already exist. If a Truckee stop already exists in the data, it can stay.

**BANNED PHRASES:** "hidden gem," "best-kept secret," "off the beaten path," "must-see," "bucket list," "nestled in," "escape the ordinary," "discover the magic," "cultural asset(s)," "charming little," "tucked away."

**Important:** Preserve all non-text fields (coordinates, stop IDs, day numbers, timing, etc.) exactly as-is. Only modify text content fields.

  <done>
All 3 itinerary titles, subtitles, descriptions rewritten culture-forward with proper nouns. All ~21 stop narratives use MUSE voice (place-first, second-person, sensory hooks, no banned transitions). All ~21 tips are clean functional register. Valid JSON. No generic tourism cliches. No banned transitions. Every narrative passes the specificity test.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Rewrite experiences.json — titles, descriptions, stop notes, connectors</name>
  <files>website/cultural-map-redesign-stitch-lab/experiences.json</files>
  <action>
Read the full experiences.json. Rewrite every text field using the same writers' room voice rules as Task 1.

**Apply all the same MUSE voice rules, banned transitions, banned phrases, and specificity test from Task 1.** Additionally:

**Experience-specific patterns:**
- X1 - Titles: Evocative, culture-forward. These are curated thematic trails — the title should promise an experience, not describe a route. Apply specificity test: "Art Walk" fails (any town). "Broad Street to Commercial Row" passes (specific to Nevada City/Grass Valley).
- X2 - Subtitles: One-line editorial hook with at least one proper noun.
- X3 - Descriptions: 2-4 sentences setting up the theme. Lead with the cultural promise, not the geography. Name at least two specific stops.
- X4 - Stop notes: 1-2 sentences per stop. Name-first, characterizing detail, second-person where natural.
- X5 - Connectors (text bridging between stops): Brief, orienting, functional. "A five-minute walk up Broad Street" not "As you meander through the charming historic district." Directional and physical, never scenic-filler.

**Corridor-specific patterns (heritage/highway routes):**
Corridors blend history with landscape. Research says MUSE uses ~50/50 evocative/informational for heritage content. Historical facts interwoven with landscape description. Lead with the cultural significance, use landscape as setting. The tourist flagged "Cultural Corridors from MUSE '26" as insider shorthand — the corridor DESCRIPTIONS should be accessible without knowing what MUSE is.

**Truckee rule:** Same as Task 1 — do not add Truckee content that doesn't already exist.

**Important:** Preserve all non-text fields (coordinates, stop arrays, route geometry, theme tags, etc.) exactly as-is. Only modify text content fields.

  </verify>
  <done>
All experience and corridor titles, subtitles, descriptions rewritten in MUSE voice with specificity test applied. All stop notes use place-first pattern with characterizing hooks. Connectors are directional and physical, not scenic filler. Valid JSON. Culture-forward positioning throughout — nature as scenic backdrop only. Every description passes the specificity test.

<success_criteria>
Itinerary and experience narratives read like MUSE magazine editorial content — place-specific, warm, second-person, with sensory hooks and short punchy closers. Every title leads with culture. No banned transitions remain. Every narrative passes the specificity test (could not describe any town in America). Nature appears only as supporting color. Both JSON files are valid and parseable.
