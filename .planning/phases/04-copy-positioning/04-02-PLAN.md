<objective>
Rewrite all narrative text in itineraries.json and experiences.json using the MUSE magazine voice. This is the bulk creative writing work of the phase — ~80 text blocks covering 3 itinerary plans and all curated experiences/corridors.

Purpose: Itinerary and experience narratives are the platform's most editorial-facing content. They must read like MUSE magazine articles — place-first, second-person, sensory, with short punchy closers. Currently they use generic informational copy that could describe any town.

Output: Fully rewritten itineraries.json (~50 blocks) and experiences.json (~30 blocks) in MUSE voice.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Rewrite itineraries.json — titles, descriptions, stop narratives, tips</name>
  <files>website/cultural-map-redesign-stitch-lab/itineraries.json</files>
  <action>
Read the full itineraries.json. Rewrite every text field using MUSE Voice Rules.

**MUSE Voice Rules for narratives:**
- Lead with the place name (proper noun first, characterizing detail second)
- Second-person direct address: "you" constantly, as if guided by a local friend
- Em-dash parenthetical color: insert vivid detail without breaking flow
- Short punchy closers: end paragraphs with a short declarative sentence
- Narrative arc: setup, exploration, payoff — even in a single paragraph
- MUSE vocabulary: "places" not "assets," "creative life," "sense of place," specific proper nouns always
- Never use: "hidden gem," "best-kept secret," "off the beaten path," "must-see," "bucket list"
- Active voice throughout

**Rewrite pattern (from research Example 4):**
Before: "Settle into a farm-to-table lunch at one of Nevada City's most beloved spots."
After: "California Organics pairs a rotating farm-to-table menu with gallery walls that change as often as the seasons. Grab the back patio in warm weather — you'll find it hard to leave."

**Structure (per itinerary):**
- J1 - Title: Short, evocative, culture-forward. Not "Day Trip to Nevada County" but something with MUSE's editorial punch. Reference what you DO (galleries, dining, performances) not where you ARE (foothills, mountains).
- J2 - Subtitle: One-line positioning in editorial register.
- J3 - Description: 2-3 sentences, sets the tone, mentions key cultural stops by name.
- J4 - Stop narratives (~7 per itinerary): Each 2-3 sentences. Name first, then sensory hook, then second-person invitation. Vary sentence length. Use em-dashes.
- J5 - Stop tips: FUNCTIONAL register. Actionable, specific, no narrative. "Free parking on Broad Street. Open 10-5 weekdays." NOT "You'll love the charming parking."

**Culture-forward rule:** Every itinerary title and description must lead with galleries, dining, performances, studios. Trails/nature mentioned ONLY as connecting tissue between cultural stops or scenic backdrop.

**Important:** Preserve all non-text fields (coordinates, stop IDs, day numbers, timing, etc.) exactly as-is. Only modify text content fields.

Validate JSON: `node -e "JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync('website/cultural-map-redesign-stitch-lab/itineraries.json','utf8')); console.log('Valid JSON')"`. Grep for "hidden gem|must-see|bucket list" (0 hits). Grep for first word of each narrative to confirm place-name-first pattern.
  </verify>
  <done>
All 3 itinerary titles, subtitles, descriptions rewritten culture-forward. All ~21 stop narratives use MUSE voice (place-first, second-person, sensory hooks). All ~21 tips are clean functional register. Valid JSON. No generic tourism cliches. Nature appears only as supporting color.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Rewrite experiences.json — titles, descriptions, stop notes, connectors</name>
  <files>website/cultural-map-redesign-stitch-lab/experiences.json</files>
  <action>
Read the full experiences.json. Rewrite every text field using MUSE Voice Rules.

**Apply the same MUSE voice rules as Task 1.** Additionally:

**Experience-specific patterns:**
- X1 - Titles: Evocative, culture-forward. These are curated thematic trails — the title should promise an experience, not describe a route.
- X2 - Subtitles: One-line editorial hook.
- X3 - Descriptions: 2-4 sentences setting up the theme. Lead with the cultural promise, not the geography.
- X4 - Stop notes: 1-2 sentences per stop. Name-first, characterizing detail, second-person where natural.
- X5 - Connectors (text bridging between stops): Brief, orienting, functional. "A five-minute walk up Broad Street" not "As you meander through the charming historic district."

**Corridor-specific patterns (heritage/highway routes):**
Corridors blend history with landscape. Research says MUSE uses ~50/50 evocative/informational for heritage content. Historical facts interwoven with landscape description. Lead with the cultural significance, use landscape as setting.

**Important:** Preserve all non-text fields (coordinates, stop arrays, route geometry, theme tags, etc.) exactly as-is. Only modify text content fields.

Validate JSON: `node -e "JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync('website/cultural-map-redesign-stitch-lab/experiences.json','utf8')); console.log('Valid JSON')"`. Grep for "cultural asset" and tourism cliches (0 hits). Spot-check 3 stop notes for place-first pattern.
  </verify>
  <done>
All experience and corridor titles, subtitles, descriptions rewritten in MUSE voice. All stop notes use place-first pattern with characterizing hooks. Connectors are clean and orienting. Valid JSON. Culture-forward positioning throughout — nature as scenic backdrop only.

1. `node -e "JSON.parse(...)"` confirms both JSON files are valid
2. `grep -i "cultural asset\|hidden gem\|must-see\|bucket list\|best-kept secret" itineraries.json experiences.json` returns 0 matches
3. Spot-read 5 random stop narratives — each starts with a proper place name
4. Each itinerary title and description leads with cultural venues, not nature
5. Tips use functional register (no narrative language)

<success_criteria>
Itinerary and experience narratives read like MUSE magazine editorial content — place-specific, warm, second-person, with sensory hooks and short punchy closers. Every title leads with culture. Nature appears only as supporting color. Both JSON files are valid and parseable.
