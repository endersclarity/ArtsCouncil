<objective>
Rewrite sub-page copy (events, itineraries), align the AI concierge personality with MUSE voice, present platform name options for committee decision, and run a full consistency sweep across all modified files.

Purpose: This plan closes all remaining copy surfaces and ensures consistency across the entire platform. The platform name is explicitly deferred to Diana/Eliza input (COPY-06), so this plan documents options and pauses for their decision.

Output: All 7 target files have MUSE-aligned copy. Platform name recommendation documented. Zero "cultural assets" anywhere in user-facing text.

  <action>
**Events page (events.html):**
- E1: Title tag — "Events — [Platform Name]" (use current name for now)
- E2: Page title — "Events Calendar" is functional and fine; verify no "cultural assets"
- E3: Subtitle — Rewrite to MUSE functional voice. Current: "X events from 5 sources across Nevada County." Rewrite: keep the count and source info but use MUSE vocabulary. "X events across Nevada County's Cultural District — from galleries, theaters, libraries, and community spaces."
- Check mast branding matches hub page mast from 04-01

**Itineraries page (itineraries.html):**
- I1: Title tag — "Trip Plans — [Platform Name]"
- I2: Page title — "Trip Itineraries" -> consider "Trip Plans" or "Curated Itineraries" (Claude's discretion on what fits MUSE voice)
- I3: Subtitle — Current: "Curated multi-day plans for exploring Nevada County's cultural district." Rewrite: lead with what you'll DO (galleries, dining, performances), not where you'll BE.
- Check mast branding matches hub page mast from 04-01

**Chat knowledge pack (chat-knowledge-pack.json):**
- K1: Read the full system prompt section of chat-knowledge-pack.json. Identify the personality/intro text.
- Rewrite the concierge personality to match MUSE voice:
  - Second-person: address the user as "you"
  - Place-specific: always recommend by proper name
  - Culture-forward: lead with galleries, dining, performances
  - Vocabulary: use MUSE terms ("places" not "assets," "creative life" not "arts scene")
  - Tone: warm, knowledgeable local friend (like MUSE's "Living Like a Local" articles)
  - Keep all functional instructions (rate limiting, safety, off-topic rejection) — only rewrite the personality/voice sections
  </action>
  <verify>
Grep all 3 files for "cultural asset" (0 hits). Verify mast branding on sub-pages matches hub. Validate chat-knowledge-pack.json is valid JSON.

  <done>
Events and itineraries sub-pages use MUSE vocabulary. Chat concierge personality matches MUSE voice — warm, place-specific, culture-forward. All functional instructions preserved. Valid JSON.

  <name>Task 2: Platform name finalization (COPY-06)</name>
  <action>
Present platform name options to the user for Diana/Eliza decision. The current name is "Explore Nevada County."
  </action>
  <decision>Platform name finalization (COPY-06)</decision>
  <context>
COPY-06 requires Diana/Eliza input on the platform name. The current name is "Explore Nevada County." Research surfaced these options:

**Current name: "Explore Nevada County"**
- Pro: Clear, functional, SEO-friendly, already established
- Con: Generic — could describe any county website, doesn't convey editorial/cultural district positioning

**Alternative options (from research):**
1. "Nevada County Cultural District" — institutional, clear, mirrors MUSE framing
2. "MUSE Explore" or "MUSE Digital" — ties to magazine brand
3. Keep current name — no change needed

The name appears in: mast h1 (3 pages), title tags (3 pages), footer, and chat concierge intro. Changing it is a find-replace across ~10 instances.

Run a comprehensive grep sweep across all 7 target files for anti-patterns identified in research. Fix any remaining instances.

**Sweep checklist:**
1. `grep -i "cultural asset"` across all 7 files — must return 0
2. `grep -i "hidden gem\|best-kept secret\|off the beaten path\|must-see attraction\|bucket list"` — must return 0
3. `grep -i "nestled in\|tucked away\|charming little"` — generic tourism filler, remove
4. Check every first sentence of narrative blocks — does it start with a proper place name or "you"? (Not "This gallery" or "A local restaurant")
5. Verify "places" appears where "assets" used to in all user-facing contexts
6. If platform name was changed in Task 2, apply the new name via find-replace across all title tags, mast h1 elements, and footer
7. Verify colophon in hub HTML credits Experience Planning Committee

**Do NOT touch:**
- Internal variable names, JSON keys, code comments
- CSS class names
- Files outside the 7 target files
  </action>
  <verify>
Run all grep checks listed above. Each must return 0 matches for anti-patterns. Run JSON validation on itineraries.json, experiences.json, chat-knowledge-pack.json. Open hub HTML and verify colophon visually.
  </verify>
  <done>
Zero anti-pattern matches across all 7 files. Platform name consistent across all surfaces (either current or renamed per Task 2 decision). All JSON valid. Colophon credits Experience Planning Committee. Phase 4 copy rewrite complete.

<success_criteria>
Every user-facing text string across all 7 files uses MUSE-derived voice. Zero anti-patterns remain. Platform name is either finalized or documented for Diana/Eliza decision. The platform reads as the Experience Planning Committee's editorial-quality digital tool from top to bottom.
