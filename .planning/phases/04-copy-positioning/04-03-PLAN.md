<objective>
Rewrite sub-page copy (events, itineraries), align the AI concierge personality with the writers' room chatbot voice direction, present platform name options for committee decision, and run a full consistency sweep across all modified files.

Purpose: This plan closes all remaining copy surfaces and ensures consistency across the entire platform. The writers' room settled a critical distinction: the chatbot uses FUNCTIONAL register (like a knowledgeable local giving quick recs), NOT editorial register (no narrative arcs, no em-dash color). The platform name is deferred to Diana/Eliza.

Output: All 7 target files have MUSE-aligned copy. Chatbot voice is functional, not editorial. Platform name recommendation documented. Zero "cultural assets" anywhere in user-facing text.

**Events page (events.html):**
- E1: Title tag — update to real SEO copy: "Events Calendar | Nevada County Arts, Music & Community Events" or similar. Remove any "Frontend Design Pass" or development artifact text.
- E2: Page title — "Events Calendar" is functional and fine; verify no "cultural assets."
- E3: Subtitle — Rewrite to MUSE functional voice. Use MUSE vocabulary: "places" not "assets." Example: "[count] events across Nevada County — from galleries, theaters, libraries, and community spaces." Keep the count and source info but drop "cultural assets" and institutional jargon.
- Mast branding: must match hub page mast from 04-01 (currently "Explore Nevada County").
- Do NOT add "Cultural District" to the events page conversational copy — it belongs only in hub cover tag + colophon.

**Itineraries page (itineraries.html):**
- I1: Title tag — update to real SEO copy: "Trip Plans | Galleries, Dining & Culture in Nevada County" or similar.
- I2: Page title — "Trip Itineraries" -> simplify to "Trip Plans" (Claude's discretion, but avoid the word "curated" per Voice Rule 6).
- I3: Subtitle — Current: "Curated multi-day plans for exploring Nevada County's cultural district." Rewrite: lead with what you'll DO, not where you'll BE. Example: "Galleries, restaurants, and performances — planned day by day." Drop "cultural district" from this conversational context.
- Add geographic context if layout permits: "Grass Valley & Nevada City, California — Sierra foothills" as a small factual line, matching the pattern from hub page (Plan 01). This is for the tourist who lands directly on the itineraries page.
- Mast branding: must match hub page.

**Chat knowledge pack (chat-knowledge-pack.json):**
This is the most important writers' room decision for this task. The editor settled a specific voice for the chatbot:

**CHATBOT VOICE = FUNCTIONAL REGISTER. NOT editorial register.**

The chatbot should sound like a knowledgeable local giving quick recommendations, NOT like a MUSE feature article.

Specific direction from the editor's assessment (Section 7):
- Direct, second-person, specific, name-first
- NO narrative arcs, NO em-dash color, NO short punchy closers
- When someone asks "where can I get dinner?" the answer names the restaurant first, gives one characterizing detail, and stops
- Think: "California Organics on Broad Street — farm-to-table, reservations recommended for weekends." NOT: "You'll discover that the creative life extends to the table at California Organics, where gallery walls change as often as the seasons..."

Rewrite the concierge personality/voice sections of the system prompt:
- Tone: warm but efficient. Knowledgeable local, not tour guide, not magazine writer.
- Always lead with the venue/event name (name-first rule still applies)
- Always use "you" (second-person rule still applies)
- Use "places" not "assets" in all responses
- Keep responses concise — the chatbot is a tool, not a reading experience
- Keep all functional instructions (rate limiting, safety, off-topic rejection, deep-link bridge instructions) — only rewrite the personality/voice sections
  </action>
  <verify>
Grep all 3 files for "cultural asset" (0 hits). Grep events.html and itineraries.html for "Frontend Design Pass" (0 hits). Verify mast branding on sub-pages matches hub. Validate chat-knowledge-pack.json is valid JSON. Read the chatbot system prompt personality section and confirm it describes a functional register, not editorial.
  </verify>
  <done>
Events and itineraries sub-pages use MUSE vocabulary with real SEO title tags. Chat concierge personality explicitly set to functional register — direct, name-first, concise, like a knowledgeable local. No editorial flourishes in chatbot voice. All functional instructions preserved. Valid JSON.

  <name>Task 2: Platform name finalization (COPY-06)</name>
  <action>
Present platform name options to the user for Diana/Eliza decision. The editor's recommendation (Section 5 of editor-assessment.md): keep "Explore Nevada County" for now, flag for Diana/Eliza.

The editor's reasoning: renaming a deployed platform is a brand decision, not a copy decision. The committee should make it. If they DO want to change, the editor recommends "MUSE Nevada County."

For now: keep the name, let the hero headline ("The Creative Life") and body copy do the positioning work that the platform name does not.
  </action>
  <decision>Platform name finalization (COPY-06)</decision>
  <context>
COPY-06 requires Diana/Eliza input on the platform name. The editor's assessment recommends keeping "Explore Nevada County" for practical reasons while noting it doesn't represent the editorial ambition.

**Editor's recommendation: Keep "Explore Nevada County" for now.**
Rationale: It's deployed, indexed by Google, has the place name, has an action verb. "A bland name with excellent copy is better than a clever name with bland copy."

**If committee wants to change, editor recommends: "MUSE Nevada County"**
Rationale: Ties to magazine brand, contains place name, signals editorial quality. Requires Diana and Eliza's blessing.

The name appears in: mast h1 (3 pages), title tags (3 pages), footer, and chat concierge intro. Changing it is a find-replace across ~10 instances.

Run a comprehensive grep sweep across all 7 target files for anti-patterns identified by the writers' room. Fix any remaining instances.

**Sweep checklist:**
1. `grep -i "cultural asset"` across all 7 files — must return 0
2. `grep -i "hidden gem\|best-kept secret\|off the beaten path\|must-see attraction\|bucket list"` — must return 0
3. `grep -i "nestled in\|tucked away\|charming little\|escape the ordinary\|discover the magic"` — must return 0
4. `grep -i "settle into\|wind down with\|stretch your legs\|ease into your day\|cap off the evening"` — must return 0 (banned transitions)
5. `grep -i "visitors will\|tourists can\|travelers should"` — must return 0 (voice rule: use "you" not third-person audience segments)
6. `grep -i "Culture .* Discovery .* 2026"` — must return 0 (dead tagline)
7. `grep -i "Frontend Design Pass"` — must return 0 (development artifact)
8. Count occurrences of "Cultural District" — should appear exactly twice on hub page (cover tag + colophon) and zero times in sub-page conversational copy. Institutional uses in colophon are fine.
9. Check every first sentence of narrative blocks — does it start with a proper place name or "you"? (Not "This gallery" or "A local restaurant")
10. Verify "places" appears where "assets" used to in all user-facing contexts
11. If platform name was changed in Task 2, apply the new name via find-replace across all title tags, mast h1 elements, and footer
12. Verify colophon in hub HTML credits Experience Planning Committee with "Created by"
13. Verify chatbot system prompt uses functional register language, not editorial

**Editor's priority order (if time runs short, fix in this order):**
1. Hero headline
2. Map panel title
3. Map active text
4. Edition tagline
5. Colophon
6. Section headers
7. MUSE section framing
8. Itinerary narratives
9. Experience descriptions
10. Utility labels

**Do NOT touch:**
- Internal variable names, JSON keys, code comments
- CSS class names
- Files outside the 7 target files
  </action>
  <verify>
Run all grep checks listed above. Each must return 0 matches for anti-patterns. Run JSON validation on itineraries.json, experiences.json, chat-knowledge-pack.json. Open hub HTML and verify colophon visually. Verify "Cultural District" count is exactly 2 on hub page.
  </verify>
  <done>
Zero anti-pattern matches across all 7 files. Platform name consistent across all surfaces. All JSON valid. Colophon credits Experience Planning Committee with "Created by." Chatbot uses functional register. "Cultural District" used precisely (cover tag + colophon only). Phase 4 copy rewrite complete.

1. `grep -ri "cultural asset" website/cultural-map-redesign-stitch-lab/*.html website/cultural-map-redesign-stitch-lab/*.js website/cultural-map-redesign-stitch-lab/*.json` — 0 matches in user-facing text
2. `grep -ri "hidden gem\|best-kept secret\|off the beaten path\|settle into\|wind down with" website/cultural-map-redesign-stitch-lab/` — 0 matches
3. `grep -ri "Culture.*Discovery.*2026\|Frontend Design Pass" website/cultural-map-redesign-stitch-lab/` — 0 matches
4. Platform name is consistent across all 3 HTML title tags and mast elements
5. All 3 JSON files parse without error
6. Colophon credits Experience Planning Committee with "Created by" (not "Crafted for")
7. Chat concierge personality uses functional register (not editorial)
8. "Cultural District" appears exactly twice on hub page and zero times in sub-page conversational copy
</verification>

<success_criteria>
Every user-facing text string across all 7 files uses MUSE-derived voice with the correct register: editorial for narrative surfaces, functional for utility surfaces, and functional (not editorial) for the chatbot. Zero anti-patterns remain. Platform name is either finalized or documented for Diana/Eliza decision. "Cultural District" is used precisely, not casually. The platform reads as the Experience Planning Committee's editorial-quality digital tool from top to bottom, with every writers' room decision implemented.
