# Platform Name Decision — For Diana/Eliza (Wednesday Feb 18)

**Status:** DECIDED — Keep "Explore Nevada County"
**Current name:** Explore Nevada County
**Decided:** 2026-02-16 (user approved)

---

## Decision

**"Explore Nevada County" stays.** The user likes it — it's fun, clear, and works. Not deferred; decided. If Diana/Eliza want to revisit, the rename options below are documented for reference.

## Background

The writers' room flagged the platform name as a brand decision, not a copy decision. The editor's position: "A bland name with excellent copy is better than a clever name with bland copy." The hero headline ("The Creative Life") and body copy already do the editorial positioning that the platform name does not.

## Options

### Option A: Keep "Explore Nevada County" (editor's recommendation)

**Pros:**
- Already deployed and indexed by Google
- Immediately clear to visitors — contains place name + action verb
- No risk of confusing users who don't know MUSE
- Zero implementation cost

**Cons:**
- Generic — could describe any tourism site
- Does not convey editorial quality or MUSE connection
- Does not differentiate from visitnevadacounty.com or similar

### Option B: Rename to "MUSE Nevada County"

**Pros:**
- Direct tie to the print journal brand
- Editorial cachet — signals this is more than a directory
- Unique in the regional tourism space

**Cons:**
- Requires Diana and Eliza's explicit approval
- May confuse first-time visitors who don't know MUSE magazine
- Implementation cost: find-replace across ~10 instances (mast h1 on 3 pages, title tags on 3 pages, footer, chat concierge intro)

If the committee chooses Option B, the rename is a straightforward find-replace across the files above. Estimated time: 5 minutes. No structural changes needed.

## Editor's full reasoning

From the editor assessment (Section 5):

> Renaming a deployed platform is a brand decision, not a copy decision. The committee should make it. If they DO want to change, I recommend "MUSE Nevada County" — it ties to the magazine brand, contains the place name, and signals editorial quality.
