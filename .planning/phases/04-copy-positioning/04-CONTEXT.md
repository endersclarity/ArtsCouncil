# Phase 4: Copy & Positioning - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-16
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Rewrite all user-facing text so the platform reads as the Experience Planning Committee's editorial-quality digital tool. Downtown/culture-forward positioning. Nature as supporting color only. Voice derived from MUSE magazine analysis. Full rewrite of every surface: hero, categories, itineraries, editorials, colophon, labels.

## Implementation Decisions

### Voice & tone
- Voice must be derived from MUSE magazine OCR analysis — not guessed, extracted
- Researcher analyzes every MUSE issue OCR available (in repo + any we can access) to extract: sentence structure, vocabulary, how they introduce places, how they balance informational vs evocative
- Also analyze the Arts Council website voice for alignment
- Whether voice is uniform or varies by section: Claude decides after research
- The MUSE voice IS the North Star — Arts Council website is secondary reference for alignment

### Downtown framing
- Nature is supporting color only. Lead with galleries, dining, performances, studios
- Trails/rivers/forests mentioned only when they connect to cultural stops or as scenic backdrop
- Hero headline positioning: let MUSE voice analysis shape the core promise (not decided in advance)
- Geography: "Nevada County Cultural District" as the umbrella brand, individual town names (Grass Valley, Nevada City, Penn Valley) used when describing specific areas
- Terminology for places/venues: Claude decides after research (no more "cultural assets")

### Category & section copy
- Full rewrite of everything — no copy carries over as-is
- Category names (Historic Landmarks, Eat Drink & Stay, etc.): Claude decides whether to rename after MUSE analysis
- All 3 itinerary narratives get full rewrite — titles, intros, and every stop description
- Colophon/credits: match MUSE's own credit/attribution patterns (researcher extracts from MUSE issues)

### Claude's Discretion
- Voice register per section (editorial everywhere vs editorial for features / functional for utilities)
- Category name changes (keep or rename based on MUSE alignment)
- Terminology for venues/places (pick what fits the extracted voice)
- Colophon language and committee positioning (match MUSE attribution patterns)
- Platform name (currently "Explore Nevada County" — assess whether this fits or needs change)

</decisions>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- User wants a research team approach: analyze MUSE OCR comprehensively, study competitor DMO language, surface stories from latest issues
- MUSE OCR is the primary source of truth for voice — every issue should be analyzed
- Arts Council website is a secondary alignment check
- The user cares about being different from generic tourism sites while coinciding with how the Arts Council naturally talks about things
- Best practices research for sites that serve both tourists and locals (if such sites exist or if this platform is pioneering that space)

</specifics>

<deferred>
## Deferred Ideas

- Competitor DMO site language analysis (Marfa, Asheville, Hudson Valley, etc.) — could be part of research but may expand scope. Researcher should at least scan 2-3 for contrast.
- "Are we the first site that serves both tourists and locals?" — interesting positioning question. Research should surface whether this dual-audience approach has precedents.
