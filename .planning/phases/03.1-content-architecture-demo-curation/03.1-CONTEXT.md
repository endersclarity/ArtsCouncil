# Phase 03.1: Content Architecture & Demo Curation - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-15
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Define the site's content architecture (single-page hub + sub-pages), curate featured content that demonstrates 5-source aggregation value, and structure content hierarchy for the Wednesday Feb 18 committee demo. Does NOT add new features — reorganizes and curates what exists.

## Implementation Decisions

### Site Architecture
- **Hub + 2 sub-pages**: Main page stays the full experience. Two dedicated sub-pages break out for deeper browsing:
  - **Events page** — full event calendar with richer filtering, list view, calendar grid
  - **Itineraries page** — browse/compare all itineraries side-by-side
- **Hub keeps full sections** — Events carousel and itinerary hero cards stay on the main page in full. Sub-pages are for deeper exploration, not replacements.
- **Routing approach:** Claude's discretion — separate HTML files or hash routing, whichever works best with vanilla JS architecture.

### Featured Content Curation
- **Demo content is hand-curated** — select specific items for Wednesday demo. No automated rotation yet.
- **Diverse source showcase** — Demo picks should include 1-2 items from each source (MUSE editorial, KVMR event, GVDA event, library program, downtown venue). All downtown-focused. The "no one else does this" proof.
- **MUSE content leads** — Use MUSE words and (if available) selectively cropped MUSE photos as primary editorial voice. Fill gaps with hand-picked downtown businesses.
- **Fairness question is OPEN** — Present to committee as an open business model question: random rotation (fair), category-balanced random, seasonal curated sets, or pay-to-play. For now it's curated for demo; automated rotation is buildable later.
- **Editorial card format:** Claude's discretion — keep as MUSE article references or evolve to blended "Editor's Picks."

### Content Hierarchy
- **Desktop: Split layout with adaptive map**
  - Hero zone: content left, map right (side-by-side)
  - Editorial/content sections: map shrinks (stays visible but smaller)
  - Map zone: map expands back to full-width or near-full
  - "View on map" interactions: map expands regardless of scroll position
- **Mobile content order:** Claude's discretion — optimize for engagement at 375px.
- **Section order on hub:** Claude's discretion — determine optimal flow for editorial tone and demo impact.

### Claude's Discretion
- Routing implementation (separate HTML vs hash routing)
- Editorial card format (MUSE references vs staff picks blend)
- Mobile content ordering
- Section order on hub page
- Exact map sizing breakpoints during scroll

</decisions>

## Specific Ideas

- "If we can show stuff that isn't easily accessible to them [the committee], but it's there clear as day, that would be pretty exciting" — the aggregation proof is the demo's key moment
- Map should feel adaptive: "at the beginning, show it a little bit, featured more strongly. As you scroll down, it shrinks. Once you clear the editorials, it can come back and fill up the width of the screen"
- MUSE as the editorial voice — this is the Arts Council's magazine, so lean on it as brand authority
- Fairness of featured content is a business model discussion for the committee, not a technical decision for us to make alone

</specifics>

<deferred>
## Deferred Ideas

- **Automated content rotation system** — Build category-balanced random or time-based rotation after committee decides on fairness model. Not for demo.
- **Pay-to-play featured placement model** — Business model question for committee. If yes, needs its own phase with payment/scheduling infrastructure.
- **About / Committee page** — Separate page for mission, colophon, "how this works" explanation. Could be Phase 4 (Copy) scope or its own mini-phase.
