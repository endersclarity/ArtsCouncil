## Current Test

[testing complete]

## Tests

### 1. Desktop split layout visible
expected: On desktop (>900px), the hub page shows content on the left and the map on the right in a side-by-side split layout. The map panel stays visible (sticky) as you scroll.
result: pass
notes: Grid 2-column (771px + 639px), map-column position:sticky top:0, map canvas rendering 589x520

### 2. Map resizes on scroll — hero zone
expected: When viewing the hero/cover section at the top, the map takes roughly 45% of the viewport width.
result: pass
notes: Hero zone grid 639/1419 = 45%. Fixed during UAT: overflow:hidden on content-column blocked IntersectionObserver, rootMargin too narrow (commit 5fdcd34)

### 3. Map resizes on scroll — editorial zone
expected: Scrolling down into the MUSE editorial / stories section, the map shrinks to a narrow sidebar (~25% width).
result: pass
notes: Editorial zone grid 355/1410 = 25%

### 4. Map resizes on scroll — expanded zone
expected: Scrolling further down to the explore/directory section, the map expands to dominate (~65% width).
result: pass
notes: Expanded zone grid 922/1410 = 65%

### 5. Feature Picks tab shows curated items
expected: Clicking the "Feature Picks" tab in the hero discovery section shows 6-8 editorial-style cards with colored source badges. Each badge indicates the source: MUSE (gold), KVMR (teal), GVDA (rust), LibCal (blue), or Local (deep-green).
result: pass
notes: 8 cards with badges: MUSE(2), KVMR(1), GVDA(1), LibCal(1), Local(3)

### 6. Feature Pick click opens detail panel
expected: Clicking a Local asset card in Feature Picks (e.g., Miners Foundry, Nevada Theatre) opens the detail side-panel with that asset's information.
result: pass
notes: Miners Foundry Cultural Center detail panel opens with description, address, category

### 7. Mobile layout fallback
expected: At mobile width (<900px), the layout is single-column. No sticky map. Map sits in its natural scroll position. No horizontal scroll or overlapping elements.
result: pass
notes: At 501px viewport: split-layout display:block, map-column position:static

### 8. Events sub-page loads and displays events
expected: Opening events.html shows all events grouped by date with date headers. Source badges appear next to each event with distinct colors per source.
result: pass
notes: 176 events, 15 date groups, 176 source badges. KVMR (teal), GVDA (rust), Trumba (gold) badges visible

### 9. Events sub-page filtering
expected: Text search filters events in real-time. Date chips (Today, Weekend, Week, 2 Weeks) filter by date range. Source dropdown filters by source. Family toggle shows only family-tagged events.
result: pass
notes: "mardi gras" search → 5 results. Family toggle → 31 results. Today chip → 15 results

### 10. Itineraries sub-page comparison view
expected: Opening itineraries.html shows 3 itinerary cards side-by-side on desktop (3-column grid). Each card shows title, duration, stop count, stop preview tags, and an "Open full itinerary" CTA button.
result: pass
notes: 3 cards: "Arts & Nature: A Perfect Day" (1 day/7 stops), "The Full Nevada County Experience" (2 days/13 stops), "Deep Dive: Art, History & Wine" (3 days/20 stops)

### 11. Itinerary deep link from sub-page to hub
expected: Clicking "Open full itinerary" on the itineraries sub-page navigates to the hub page with the correct ?itinerary= parameter, and the itinerary overlay opens.
result: pass
notes: CTA navigates to hub with ?itinerary=perfect-day, overlay class "itinerary-overlay active" display:flex

### 12. Hub navigation links to sub-pages
expected: The hub page nav bar includes links to "Events" and "Itineraries". The events section has a "See all events" link. The itinerary section has a "Compare all itineraries" link. All link to the correct sub-pages.
result: pass
notes: Nav has Events→events.html and Itineraries→itineraries.html. 4 total links to sub-pages (2 nav + 2 contextual)

### 13. Sub-pages have consistent styling and back navigation
expected: Both events.html and itineraries.html have matching header/footer styling with the hub. Both have a "Back to Explore" link that returns to the hub page.
result: pass
notes: Both pages have matching header with brand pill, "Back to Explore" link to hub

### 14. No JS console errors on hub
expected: The hub page loads without new JavaScript errors in the console. Events, itineraries, chat widget, detail panel, and explore directory all still work.
result: pass
notes: Zero JS errors caught by window.onerror listener
