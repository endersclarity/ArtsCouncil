# Phase 01.1: Demo Visual Polish - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-16
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Ship visual polish for the Wed Feb 18 committee demo. Hero overhaul, hybrid navigation, AI style cards (in-chat only), email capture, community photo grid, editorial deep links. Informed by DESIGN-SPEC.md (24 decisions) and PRIORITIZED-ACTION-PLAN.md (build order).

Target: `website/cultural-map-redesign-stitch-lab/` (stitch-lab Vercel deploy)

## Implementation Decisions

### Hero Visual Treatment
- **Photo carousel above hero:** 8-10 diverse Nevada County shots (downtown, galleries, food, art, nightlife, nature, people). Auto-rotate. Swipeable.
- **Hero section below carousel:** ~50vh (half viewport). Clean, minimal.
- **Centered brand element:** Text lockup ("Explore Nevada County" in Playfair Display) PLUS a scalable SVG logo/badge. Both present — text lockup is primary masthead, SVG logo is complementary.
- **Hero background:** Single image with **soft blur** behind the brand mark area so text pops without competing with the image.
- **SVG logo:** Needs to be generated (we don't have one). Must scale cleanly from mobile to desktop.

### Navigation Restructure
- **Top bar (desktop):** Brand mark left, expandable search icon, 4 inline nav links: **Events, Itineraries, Map, MUSE**. Hamburger on the right.
- **Top bar (mobile):** Brand mark left, search icon, hamburger right. Three elements only.
- **Search:** Magnifying glass icon that expands to full search field on click. Not always-visible field.
- **Hamburger position:** Left side of screen (slides in from left), NOT right.
- **Hamburger width:** Content-adaptive — only as wide as the content needs, not forced 80% or full-screen.
- **Hamburger contents:** Everything with progressive disclosure. Categories (collapsible), Events, Itineraries, Experiences, MUSE, Map, About/Contact. Nothing left out, but nested under expandable sections.
- **Map nav link:** Clicking "Map" from top bar expands map to full prominence. Claude decides which filter controls appear in map mode (category filters, Open Now, events are candidates).

### AI Concierge Style Cards
- **Placement:** Inside the chat panel ONLY. No page teasers, no floating cards near FAB. The AI stays invisible until someone actively opens it.
- **Philosophy:** Minimize AI presence. Don't lure users into chatbot conversations. Demo the capability by opening the chat, not by advertising it.
- **Card themes:** Claude decides (4-6 cards based on knowledge pack data and demo flow).
- **Chat FAB:** Restyle to match the new design language. Keep subtle.

### Email Capture & Footer
- **Placement:** Footer section (before colophon). Not mid-page.
- **CTA tone:** Friendly editorial — "Stay in the loop — weekly updates on events and hidden gems in Nevada County."
- **Backend:** Google Sheet via Apps Script for the demo. Zero cost, committee can see signups.
- **Stretch goal:** Beehiiv setup (free tier, up to 2,500 subscribers) alongside the demo.

### Community Photo Grid
- **Include:** Yes, 6-8 curated photos near the footer.
- **CTA:** "Tag #ExploreNevadaCounty to be featured."
- **Photo sourcing:** Real photos where available (MUSE assets, our existing images, Arts Council Instagram if accessible), AI-generated to fill gaps.
- **Stretch goal:** Investigate Instagram oEmbed API or aggregator widget for live feed. NOT for demo — static grid first.
- **Important:** Never download and re-host someone else's photos. Always embed or link back (copyright).

### Claude's Discretion
- Map mode controls (which filters appear when Map is clicked from top bar)
- AI Concierge style card themes and count
- Carousel photo selection and auto-rotate timing
- SVG logo/badge design approach
- Exact hamburger menu section organization
- Animation/transition choices for navigation interactions
- Photo grid layout (masonry vs grid vs staggered)

</decisions>

## Specific Ideas

- Photo carousel above hero inspired by travel publication sites — diverse shots cycling through to set the mood
- Hero should feel like a magazine cover, not a webpage header
- Hamburger menu slides from the left (not right) — only as wide as needed
- "I don't want someone to get hoodwinked into a chatbot conversation" — AI presence should be minimal unless user seeks it out
- Diana explicitly asked for itineraries — having "Itineraries" in the top nav shows we listened
- User wants to see the half-viewport hero first — easy to adjust to full viewport later if it looks better
- MUSE as a top-level nav link signals the editorial/magazine connection to the committee

## Deferred Ideas

- **Instagram live feed integration** — Investigate oEmbed API or Curator.io/Elfsight for real-time community photos. Stretch goal, not demo requirement.
- **Beehiiv email platform** — Set up free tier alongside Google Sheet. Enables future newsletters with proper deliverability.
- **Arts Council Instagram mining** — Check if the Arts Council has an Instagram account with usable photo assets.
- **Video hero** — Aspirational enhancement. Would need video assets that don't exist yet.
- **Content submission form** — "Know a hidden gem? Tell us about it." Google Form for community submissions. Mentioned in DESIGN-SPEC but not demo scope.
