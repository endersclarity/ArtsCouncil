  - phase: 02.1-kvmr-gvda-event-source-ingestion
    provides: "KVMR iCal ingest pattern, venue_aliases.json, merge pipeline"
provides:
  - "4 new live music venues in data.json (Bodhi Hive, The Fern, Stardust Station, The Unchurch)"
  - "Crazy Horse iCal ingest script (Source 6)"
  - "Parameterized Squarespace JSON ingest script (Sources 7-8)"
  - "Venue aliases for new venue name variants"

key-decisions:
  - "Crazy Horse venue_name hardcoded (single-venue iCal feed, no location parsing needed)"
  - "Squarespace ingest defaults venue_city to Nevada City (all current targets are NC venues)"
  - "Bodhi Hive returns 0 events (no upcoming events listed) -- script handles gracefully"

patterns-established:
  - "Parameterized Squarespace ingest: same script serves multiple venues via CLI args"
  - "Event output wraps in {generated_at, events[]} envelope matching other ingest scripts"

# Phase 02.2 Plan 01: Venue Data & Ingest Scripts Summary

**4 live music venues added to data.json, 2 closed Ol' Republic entries removed, plus Crazy Horse iCal and parameterized Squarespace JSON ingest scripts producing 10 + 6 events**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 3 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-17T07:21:19Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-17T07:24:36Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 4

## Accomplishments
- Added Bodhi Hive, The Fern, Stardust Station, and The Unchurch to data.json (net +2 venues: 685 -> 687)
- Removed permanently closed Ol' Republic Brewery and Ol' Republic Roadhouse
- Created Crazy Horse iCal ingest script producing 10 upcoming events
- Created parameterized Squarespace ingest script working for both Golden Era (6 events) and Bodhi Hive (0 events)
- Updated venue_aliases.json with 4 new venue name mappings

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Update data.json with 4 new venues and remove Ol' Republic** - `066aec8` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Create Crazy Horse iCal and Squarespace JSON ingest scripts** - `c8f0519` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified
- `website/cultural-map-redesign-stitch-lab/data.json` - 4 new venues added, 2 Ol' Republic removed (687 total)
- `scripts/events/venue_aliases.json` - Added Bodhi-Hive, Crazy Horse, Golden Era, The Fern aliases
- `scripts/events/ingest_crazyhorse_ical.py` - iCal ingest for Crazy Horse Saloon WordPress Events Calendar
- `scripts/events/ingest_squarespace_events.py` - Parameterized Squarespace JSON ingest for Golden Era and Bodhi Hive

## Decisions Made
- Crazy Horse venue_name is hardcoded to "Crazy Horse Saloon & Grill" since the iCal feed is single-venue
- Squarespace script defaults venue_city to "Nevada City" for all current target venues
- Bodhi Hive currently has 0 upcoming events -- script handles empty arrays gracefully
- New venue categories per locked decision: Bodhi Hive/Stardust Station/The Unchurch = Performing Arts, The Fern = Eat, Drink & Stay

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered
None

## User Setup Required
None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- Ingest scripts ready for integration into merge pipeline (02.2-02)
- Golden Era Lounge not yet in data.json (covered by 02.2-02 or 02.2-03)
- GitHub Actions workflow needs updating to include new ingest steps (02.2-03)

## Self-Check: PASSED

All files verified present. Both commits (066aec8, c8f0519) confirmed in git log.
