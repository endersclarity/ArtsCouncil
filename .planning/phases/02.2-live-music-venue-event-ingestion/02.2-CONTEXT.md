# Phase 02.2: Live Music & Venue Event Ingestion - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-16
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Surface Nevada County's live music scene by adding 4 missing venues to data.json (full parity), removing 1 closed venue, ingesting venue-owned event feeds as sources 6-9 in the daily pipeline, creating an event type tag system (Live Music + 3-4 others), and building a community submission form for venues without structured calendars. Dedicated Live Music subpage is out of scope for this phase.

## Implementation Decisions

### Venue data strategy
- Add 4 new venues with **full parity** (name, address, hours, phone, website, description, coordinates, category) — same fields as existing 687 assets
- **Category mapping:** Bodhi Hive → Performance Spaces, The Fern → Eat/Drink/Stay, Stardust Station → Performance Spaces, The Unchurch → Performance Spaces
  - **Technical note:** The canonical category value for performing arts venues in `index-maplibre-config.js` CATS object is "Performance Spaces" (exact string match required for color lookup). This is the value used by 26 other performance venues in data.json. Any reference to "Performing Arts" in planning documents is informal shorthand for the venue PURPOSE, not the technical category field value.
- **Venue category vs event tag are distinct:** venue category = what the place IS (bar, performance hall), event tag = what kind of event it HOSTS (Live Music). These are orthogonal.
- **Ol' Republic: Remove entirely** from data.json — permanently closed, domain hijacked. No "closed" marker, just delete.

### Event tagging system
- Build a **multi-tag system from the start**: Live Music + Family & Kids + Arts/Gallery + Community (3-4 tags)
- Tags surface as **options in the existing source dropdown** filter (not a separate filter dimension)
- **Family & Kids special behavior:** present in the tag system but **off by default** — family events hidden unless user actively toggles it on (they dominate the list otherwise). Dual presence: available as a filter, but default-excluded.
- **Auto-tagging strategy:** Claude's Discretion — combine keyword matching on title/description with source-based defaults (events from live music venues default to Live Music tag)

### Scraping & ingestion tiers
- **Tier 1 (iCal):** Crazy Horse Saloon — iCal subscribe, same pattern as KVMR
- **Tier 2 (HTML scraping):** Golden Era Lounge + Bodhi Hive — Squarespace /events page scrapers
- **Tier 2 (Bandsintown API):** The Fern — use Bandsintown structured API instead of scraping their Live Schedule page (more reliable)
- **Tier 3 (Community submission):** Stardust Station + The Unchurch — manual form submission
- **Scraper robustness:** Best-effort, fail silently — same continue-on-error pattern as KVMR/GVDA. If a site changes layout, that source drops out until fixed.
- **Frequency:** Daily, same cron as existing 5-source pipeline — one unified GitHub Actions workflow
- **Dedup priority:** Claude's Discretion — venue-specific sources should generally win for their own events (better data quality for shows at that venue)

### Community submission form
- **Backend:** Claude's Discretion (Google Form → Sheet is the likely path given zero-custom-backend constraint)
- **Form location:** Claude's Discretion (standalone or embedded)
- **Moderation:** Manual approval required — Kaelen marks rows as 'approved' in Google Sheet, pipeline only ingests approved rows
- **Required fields (bare minimum):** Event name, date/time, venue (dropdown)
- **Optional fields:** Description, ticket URL, image URL, event type tags, recurring flag
- **UX:** Pre-populated dropdowns for venue (known venues list) and event type (Live Music, Family, etc.) + date picker. Minimal friction.
- **Venue dropdown includes 'Other' + free text** — allows submissions for venues not yet in the system. Kaelen reviews and potentially adds new venues.

</decisions>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- Venue category and event type tag are explicitly orthogonal — a bar (Eat/Drink/Stay) can host Live Music events. Don't conflate venue categories with event types.
- Family & Kids events should be filterable but off by default because they overwhelm the event list when mixed in with everything else.
- Submission form should be as frictionless as possible — preloaded schema, dropdowns, date picker. Venue owners pick from a list, not type free text for known fields.

</specifics>

<deferred>
## Deferred Ideas

- Dedicated "Live Music" subpage — potential future phase (roadmap mentions it as an option)
- Agentic browser cron for scraping (mentioned in roadmap deferred items) — overkill for now
- Event categorization taxonomy unification across all sources — broader effort than this phase

</deferred>
