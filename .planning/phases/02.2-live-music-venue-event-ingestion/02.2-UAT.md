## Current Test

[testing complete]

## Tests

### 1. New Venues Visible on Map
expected: Searching or browsing the map shows Bodhi Hive, The Fern, Stardust Station, and The Unchurch as markers/entries in the directory. Bodhi Hive/Stardust Station/The Unchurch categorized as Performing Arts, The Fern as Eat, Drink & Stay.
result: issue
reported: "All 4 venues are in data.json and render as map markers (confirmed via queryRenderedFeatures). Categories correct: Bodhi Hive/Stardust/Unchurch = Performing Arts, The Fern = Eat, Drink & Stay. However: Performing Arts venues render with grey #999 color instead of a category color because the config category list uses 'Performance Spaces' not 'Performing Arts' — category name mismatch between data.json and config.js"
severity: minor

### 2. Ol' Republic Removed
expected: Searching for "Ol' Republic" in the directory returns no results. No markers for Ol' Republic Brewery or Ol' Republic Roadhouse on the map.
result: pass

### 3. Crazy Horse Events Appear
expected: Events from Crazy Horse Saloon & Grill appear in the events section with source badge indicating the source. At least some upcoming events visible.
result: pass

### 4. Golden Era Events Appear
expected: Events from Golden Era Lounge appear in the events section with source badge. At least some upcoming events visible.
result: issue
reported: "Golden Era has 6 events in events-merged-flat.json (confirmed: DOMINIC STEPANIAN, MOM & DOM, JOHN VOELZ etc with venue_name=Golden Era Lounge). But source filter 'source:goldenera' shows 0 events because their source_type is 'squarespace' not 'goldenera'. The events model filters by source_type field which doesn't match the dropdown value. The Squarespace ingest script sets a generic source_type instead of a venue-specific one."
severity: major

### 5. Event Tag Filter - Live Music
expected: Events dropdown includes a "By Type" section with "Live Music" option. Selecting it filters the event list to show only events tagged as live-music. Scope label shows "Live Music" (not "tag:live-music").
result: pass

### 6. Event Source Filter
expected: Events dropdown includes a "By Source" section with individual source options (e.g., KVMR, GVDA, Crazy Horse). Selecting one filters events to that source only. Scope label shows human-readable source name.
result: issue
reported: "Crazy Horse source filter works correctly (9 events, scope label shows 'Source: Crazy Horse'). Golden Era source filter shows 0 events — same root cause as Test 4: source_type mismatch. Bodhi Hive would have same issue (0 events currently anyway). The dropdown UI with optgroups and human-readable labels works correctly."
severity: major

### 7. Submit Event Page Loads
expected: Navigating to submit-event.html shows an editorial-styled event submission page with a Google Form embed or placeholder for community event submissions.
result: pass

### 8. Event Tags in Data
expected: Events in the merged events feed include event_tags arrays (e.g., ["live-music"]) on venue-sourced events. Tag data is present and drives the filter system.
result: pass
