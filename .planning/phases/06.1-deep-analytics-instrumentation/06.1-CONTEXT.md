# Phase 06.1: Deep Analytics Instrumentation - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-15
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Add deeper analytics instrumentation beyond what Phase 6 shipped. Phase 6 delivered the Umami wrapper, 15+ basic interaction events, UTM outbound links, and dedup throttle. Phase 6.1 fills tracking gaps: map marker clicks, route/itinerary activation, detail panel engagement, phone/directions clicks, and any other high-value interactions that Phase 6 missed. Goal: even a few synthetic walkthrough sessions before the Wednesday demo produce enough data to tell a compelling story about visitor behavior.

## Implementation Decisions

### Map interaction tracking
- Claude's discretion on marker click tracking detail level (asset name, category, city — Claude picks the right granularity)
- Claude's discretion on whether to track map zoom/pan (signal-to-noise tradeoff)
- Track route and itinerary activation events from the map — know which experiences and itineraries people engage with
- Claude's discretion on detail panel dwell time (implementation effort vs. value tradeoff)

### Outbound attribution
- Claude identifies what Phase 6 already covers and fills remaining gaps (phone clicks, directions clicks, any missed outbound actions)
- Keep raw kebab-case event naming convention from Phase 6 — no human-readable renaming
- Capture all venue/category data in event properties — data extraction and pretty-formatting happens later via Claude/reporting (Phase 7)
- The single most important data point for the committee: "How many people clicked through to a business" — total outbound click count must be clearly capturable from Umami data

### Dashboard storytelling
- Default Umami dashboard is sufficient for Phase 6.1 — no custom filtered views needed
- Demo approach: both live Umami dashboard glance + Claude-generated narrative report for deeper story
- Filtered views, charts, and polished presentations are Phase 7 / reporting layer scope — not Phase 6.1

### Claude's Discretion
- Marker click tracking granularity (name only vs. name+category vs. name+category+city)
- Whether map zoom/pan tracking is worth the noise
- Detail panel dwell time implementation (buckets vs. open/close only)
- Any additional interaction gaps Claude identifies between Phase 6 and what makes a rich demo dataset

## Specific Ideas

- The site won't have real traffic by Wednesday's demo — the approach is synthetic walkthroughs followed by data interrogation to see if the story surfaces naturally
- "We'll translate that shit on our own" — raw data in Umami is fine, Claude handles extraction and formatting
- User wants to eventually learn Claude + Excel integration for compelling slideshows/charts/graphs (not this phase)
- The proof-of-concept for the committee is: do a walkthrough, then pull the data and ask "can we extrapolate a visitor story from this?" — if yes, the instrumentation works

</specifics>

<deferred>
## Deferred Ideas

- Claude + Excel integration for charts, graphs, and committee presentations — explore during Phase 7 or as separate workflow
- Synthetic walkthrough test script (checklist exercising all tracked events) — add to UAT/verification, not Phase 6.1 implementation
- Reverse-engineering user stories from analytics data — UAT verification activity after all instrumentation is live
- Custom Umami dashboard filtered views — Phase 7 reporting scope
