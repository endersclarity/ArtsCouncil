## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 7 phases, reordered to prioritize Diana's explicit asks over PRD expansions
- [Roadmap]: MVP = Phases 1-5 (42 reqs: Design, Tier 2 Events, Itineraries, Copy, AI Concierge) -- delivers everything Diana asked for plus comprehensive content
- [Roadmap]: Growth = Phases 6-7 (22 reqs: Analytics, Reporting) -- committee value-adds
- [Roadmap]: Tier 2 Events moved from Phase 6 to Phase 2 -- more content early means better itineraries, better AI answers, better copy decisions
- [Roadmap]: AI Concierge depends on Phases 2+3 (needs event + itinerary data)
- [Roadmap]: Copy & Positioning depends on Phases 1+3 (design + itinerary content to review)
- [Roadmap]: Analytics has no hard upstream dependency, sequenced after MVP for committee value-add
- [Roadmap]: Reporting depends on Phases 5+6 (needs chatbot logs + analytics data)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 5 (AI Concierge): Gemini free tier may not cover projected token usage at 500 monthly visitors
- Phase 5 (AI Concierge): data.json needs status/last_verified fields before chatbot can safely recommend venues
- Phase 2 (Events): LibCal API access for Nevada County Library not yet verified
- Phase 2 (Events): CivicEngage iCal export assumed but not confirmed for GV/NC municipal sites
