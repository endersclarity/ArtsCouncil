### Purpose — Why This Exists

Nevada County contains 687 cultural assets across 10 categories — from Gold Rush landmarks and Julia Morgan architecture to independent bookstores and poetry festivals. Most of these assets are invisible to visitors and even to locals. The Arts Council's existing ArcGIS map presents this data in a gray, default GIS interface that nobody browses for pleasure.

This project exists to make the cultural wealth of Nevada County discoverable, browsable, and beautiful. To give the Arts Council a flagship digital product that matches the quality of the culture it represents.

### Values — What We Believe

1. **Place matters.** Every pin on this map is a real building, trail, stage, or gathering place. The land shapes the culture.
2. **Story over data.** A GIS database has coordinates. A cultural map has narratives. Every asset has a story worth telling.
3. **Craft honors craft.** The artisans, performers, and preservationists of Nevada County deserve a product built with the same care they put into their work.
4. **Stewardship, not ownership.** This data belongs to the community. We present it; we don't gatekeep it.
5. **Access is the point.** If a tourist can't find the Bridgeport Covered Bridge, it might as well not exist. Discoverability is cultural preservation.

### Personality — How We Behave

- **Warm authority.** We know this county deeply but we're not lecturing. We're the knowledgeable friend who grew up here.
- **Quiet confidence.** No flashy animations for their own sake. Every design choice earns its place. The 2019 designer called this "quiet graphics" and she was right.
- **Earned intimacy.** The more you explore, the more the map reveals. Connector text between stops. Drop-cap first letters. Detail panels that reward clicking.
- **Grounded, not precious.** This is Gold Country, not a museum gift shop. The tone should feel like reading a well-written regional magazine, not an art catalog.

## Brand Strategy

### Brand Purpose

To transform how Nevada County's cultural assets are discovered, explored, and valued — by visitors, residents, and the institutions that sustain them.

### Brand Vision

The gold standard for how any county in America presents its cultural identity online. Proof that a rural arts council can ship a product that rivals anything built by a major metro.

### Brand Mission

Map every cultural asset in Nevada County. Connect them through curated narratives. Present them in a digital experience that honors the original "quiet graphics" vision the Arts Council imagined in 2019 but never shipped.

### Brand Values

| Value | Definition |
|-------|-----------|
| **Place** | The physical landscape — mountains, rivers, Main Street storefronts — is inseparable from the culture. Geography is destiny. |
| **Story** | Data becomes culture when you add narrative. We don't just list assets; we connect them through history, theme, and experience. |
| **Craft** | The product itself is a cultural artifact. Typography, color, animation, prose — each element is intentional. |
| **Stewardship** | We serve the community's data, not our ego. Open data, honest presentation, credit to sources. |
| **Access** | If it's not easy to find, filter, and explore, we haven't done our job. |

### Target Audience

**Primary: Visitors and tourists**
- Planning a trip to Nevada County or already here
- Looking for things to do beyond skiing and hiking
- Browsing on mobile, often in the car or at a coffee shop
- Want curated recommendations, not a data dump

**Secondary: Local residents**
- Lifelong locals discovering what's in their backyard
- Newcomers (remote workers, Bay Area transplants) exploring their new home
- Want depth — history, hours, directions, context

**Tertiary: Institutional stakeholders**
- Arts Council board members showing the product to funders
- Grant reviewers evaluating community impact
- Cultural organizations wanting their listing to look good
- County officials evaluating arts investment ROI

### Brand Positioning Statement

For **visitors and residents of Nevada County** who want to discover the region's cultural richness beyond the obvious attractions, **The Culture of Gold Country** is an **interactive cultural atlas** that transforms 687 scattered assets into a cohesive, explorable narrative of place. Unlike the **existing ArcGIS map** (which is a generic GIS interface) and **Google Maps embeds** (which have no editorial voice), we combine **curated storytelling, 3D terrain visualization, and magazine-quality design** to make cultural discovery feel like reading a beautiful publication, not querying a database.

### Brand Personality Traits

- **Editorial** — We write like a magazine, not a municipal website
- **Warm** — Earth tones, hand-painted watercolors, inviting not intimidating
- **Authoritative** — 687 assets, 10 categories, every coordinate verified
- **Restrained** — "Quiet graphics." No gratuitous animation, no neon, no clutter
- **Local** — We name the streets, the buildings, the people. We've been here.

### Brand Promise

Every cultural asset in Nevada County, presented with the care it deserves.

### Proof Points

- 687 verified cultural assets across 10 categories, sourced from the Arts Council's ArcGIS dataset
- 5 curated experiences with hand-written narrative connecting stops
- 3 Cultural Corridors mapped to the Arts Council's MUSE magazine content
- 3D terrain visualization on MapTiler Landscape — the actual topography of the Sierra foothills
- Watercolor illustrations honoring the Arts Council's original 2019 presentation deck
- Quatrefoil badge preserving the original brand mark

## Brand Positioning

### Step 1: Market Analysis

**Category:** County/regional cultural asset maps

**Competitive landscape:**

| Product | Approach | Strength | Weakness |
|---------|----------|----------|----------|
| Nevada County Arts Council ArcGIS map | Default Esri web map | Complete data, authoritative source | Generic gray UI, no narrative, no mobile optimization, no curation |
| Visit Nevada County (tourism site) | Listings and event calendar | SEO, official tourism channel | No map visualization, no cultural focus |
| Google Maps "things to do" | Algorithmic suggestions | Ubiquitous, reviews | No curation, no cultural categories, commercial bias |
| Other county cultural maps (Marin, Sonoma) | Basic Google Maps embeds or WordPress plugins | Low cost | No visual identity, no storytelling, no differentiation |
| City cultural district maps (SF, Portland) | Custom-built, funded | High production value | Urban focus, big budgets, not replicable for rural counties |

**White space:** No rural county in California has a purpose-built, editorially designed interactive cultural map. The gap between "default GIS tool" and "real product" is enormous. This is the gap we fill.

**Market trends:**
- Cultural tourism growing faster than general tourism post-COVID
- "Authentic experiences" are the #1 traveler desire (vs. packaged tours)
- Arts councils nationwide moving from event calendars to digital storytelling
- 3D map experiences (Google Earth, MapBox storytelling) raising expectations

### Step 2: Audience Understanding

**Visitor needs:**
- "What should I do in Nevada City this weekend?"
- "I have two hours before dinner — what's nearby?"
- "I want to go somewhere most tourists don't know about"
- "Show me a route, not a list"

**Visitor pain points:**
- Existing ArcGIS map is ugly and hard to use on mobile
- Tourism sites are SEO-optimized listicles, not explorable maps
- No way to filter by interest (just galleries? just hiking?)
- No narrative connecting places — just pins on a map

**Local needs:**
- "I've lived here 20 years and never heard of this place"
- "Where do I take visiting friends to impress them?"
- "What's the story behind that building I drive past every day?"

**Stakeholder needs:**
- "Show our grant funder what 687 cultural assets looks like"
- "Prove that the Grass Valley-Nevada City Cultural District is real"
- "Make the Cultural Corridors concept tangible"

**Decision drivers:**
- Visual quality (first impression determines engagement)
- Mobile usability (most visitors browse on phones)
- Curation (too many pins = overwhelm; guided experiences = engagement)
- Credibility (Arts Council endorsement matters to institutions)

### Step 3: Differentiation

**Unique capabilities:**
- Only map product that combines the complete Arts Council dataset with editorial narrative
- Only cultural map with curated thematic experiences and corridor routes
- Only rural county cultural map with 3D terrain visualization
- Only product that brings the 2019 "quiet graphics" watercolor vision to life

**Competitive advantages:**
- Data completeness: 687 assets vs. tourism sites' curated top-20 lists
- Design quality: Magazine-grade typography and color vs. default GIS gray
- Narrative depth: Connector text between stops vs. bare pin markers
- Technical ambition: MapLibre GL JS with 3D terrain vs. Leaflet/Google Maps embed

**Category entry points:**
- "Nevada County cultural map" (search)
- Arts Council website link (referral)
- MUSE magazine QR code (print-to-digital)
- Social media shares of specific experiences (viral)
- Grant applications (institutional)

**Reasons to believe:**
- Built on the Arts Council's authoritative ArcGIS dataset
- Watercolor assets trace directly to the 2019 original designer's work
- MUSE theme colors pulled from the actual MUSE '26 Issue 03 publication
- Corridor routes match the Arts Council's published cultural corridor concept

### Step 4: Positioning Statement

> For visitors and residents exploring Nevada County's cultural identity, The Culture of Gold Country is the interactive atlas that connects 687 cultural assets through curated narratives, 3D terrain, and editorial design. Unlike generic GIS maps and tourism listicles, we present culture as a landscape to be explored — not a database to be searched.

## Visual Identity System

### Logo / Brand Mark

**Primary mark:** The quatrefoil badge — a four-lobed shape containing a watercolor mountain landscape with the text "Nevada County Cultural Assets." This mark was created for the Arts Council's 2019 presentation deck and is the closest thing to an official logo for the cultural asset mapping initiative.

**Usage:**
- Appears as a ghosted watermark in the hero section (8% opacity)
- Used as the category icon for general/overview contexts
- Available as `watercolor-badge-quatrefoil.png` and `img/watercolor/badge.png`
- Never displayed at full opacity as a standalone logo on the web product — it serves as a textural/heritage element

**Wordmark:** The site title "The Culture of Gold Country" set in Playfair Display 900 weight is the effective wordmark. The word "Culture" is italicized in gold (`#c8943e`) as the visual anchor.

### Color Palette

#### Core Palette

| Name | Hex | CSS Variable | Role |
|------|-----|-------------|------|
| **Cream** | `#f5f0e8` | `--cream` | Primary background. The canvas. Used on all body sections. |
| **Ink** | `#1a1612` | `--ink` | Primary text. Hero and colophon backgrounds. The darkest value. |
| **Gold** | `#c8943e` | `--gold` | Primary accent. Links, highlights, hero title emphasis, stat numbers, hover states. The brand's signature color. |
| **Gold Bright** | `#daa94e` | `--gold-bright` | Stat counters, emphasis moments. Slightly warmer/lighter than gold. |
| **Parchment** | `#ede6d8` | `--parchment` | Secondary background. Map section, alternating sections. Slightly warmer than cream. |
| **Rust** | `#a0522d` | `--rust` | Section eyebrow labels, warm accent. The Arts Council's earth tone. |
| **Deep Green** | `#2d4a3e` | `--deep-green` | Forest/nature accent. Used sparingly — hero radial gradient, arts category. |
| **Slate** | `#4a4a4a` | `--slate` | Secondary text. Body copy, descriptions, metadata. Softer than ink. |
| **Red Accent** | `#8b2500` | `--red-accent` | Landmarks category, urgent/heritage emphasis. |
| **Blue Wash** | `#3a5f7c` | `--blue-wash` | Links in detail panel, cultural category. A restrained, desaturated blue. |

#### Category Colors

Each of the 10 asset categories has a dedicated color used consistently across category cards, filter pills, map markers, list item bars, and detail panel accents.

| Category | Label | Hex | CSS Variable |
|----------|-------|-----|-------------|
| Historical Landmarks | Landmarks | `#8b2500` | `--cat-landmarks` |
| Eat & Drink | Eat & Drink | `#a67830` | `--cat-eat` |
| Arts Organizations | Arts Orgs | `#2d4a3e` | `--cat-arts` |
| Cultural Organizations | Cultural | `#3a5f7c` | `--cat-cultural` |
| Fairs & Festivals | Fairs | `#a0522d` | `--cat-fairs` |
| Galleries & Studios | Galleries | `#6b4e71` | `--cat-galleries` |
| Walks & Trails | Walks | `#4a7c5f` | `--cat-walks` |
| Public Art | Public Art | `#c45d3e` | `--cat-publicart` |
| Performance Venues | Performance | `#2a6496` | `--cat-performance` |
| Preservation Sites | Preservation | `#5c5020` | `--cat-preservation` |

**Color usage rules:**
- Category colors are used as accent indicators (dots, bars, pills, marker fills), never as backgrounds for large areas
- On light backgrounds, category colors appear at 70-100% opacity for interactive elements, 35% for passive indicators
- On dark backgrounds (tooltips, corridor panel), category colors appear at full saturation against near-black
- The "All" filter pill uses `--ink` as its active background, not a category color
- Active filter pills fill with their category color and switch text to white

#### MUSE Theme Colors (Cultural Corridors)

Applied when any Cultural Corridor experience is active. Sourced directly from MUSE '26 Issue 03.

| Name | Hex | Role |
|------|-----|------|
| **Teal** | `#2a8c8c` | Primary accent. Corridor section headers, active state highlights. |
| **Burnt Rust** | `#b85c38` | Secondary accent. Route lines for Gold Rush Heritage. Illustrated mountain palette. |
| **Sage** | `#7a9e7e` | Tertiary accent. Illustrated map background tones. |
| **Warm Cream** | `#f2ece4` | MUSE-mode background. Slightly warmer than default cream. |
| **Dark Gray** | `#2c2c2c` | MUSE-mode text. Softer than ink. |
| **Warm Gray** | `#c5bdb0` | Dimmed (non-active) marker color during MUSE mode. |

**Per-corridor route colors:**
- Gold Rush Heritage Trail: `#b85c38` (burnt rust)
- Highway 40 Overland: `#5b8a72` (forest green)
- Highway 20 Yuba Divide: `#6b4e71` (plum)
- Highway 49 Arts Trail: `#2a6496` (deep blue)

### Typography

#### Type Scale

| Role | Font | Weight | Size | Tracking | CSS Variable |

| **Monospace metadata** | JetBrains Mono | 400-500 | 0.55-0.7rem | 0.05-0.2em | `--font-mono` |

**Typography rules:**

- **Playfair Display** is reserved for display type: titles, headings, stat numbers, category counts. Never used for body text. Always bold (700) or black (900). Italics are reserved for the word "Culture" in the hero title and for emphasis in headings.
- **DM Sans** is the workhorse. All body copy, UI labels, buttons, descriptions. Weights 300 (light) through 700 (bold). The default reading font.
- **JetBrains Mono** is the signifier of structure. Used for eyebrow labels, section tags, metadata, and any element that says "this is a category" or "this is a system label." Always uppercase, always letter-spaced (0.05em minimum). Never used for body copy.
- All text uses `-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased` for consistent rendering on macOS.
- Drop-cap first letters in detail panel descriptions use Playfair Display at 2.5em, colored gold.

### Imagery Style Guide

#### Watercolor Illustrations

The project uses 11 hand-painted watercolor illustrations in muted earth tones, created to match the Arts Council's 2019 presentation deck aesthetic. These are the visual soul of the brand.

**Assets:**

| File | Subject | Used For |
|------|---------|----------|
| `landmarks.png` | Red barn | Historical Landmarks category |
| `eat-drink.png` | Wine bottle and glass | Eat & Drink category |
| `arts.png` | Camera | Arts Organizations category |
| `cultural.png` | Coffee cup | Cultural Organizations category |
| `fairs.png` | Directional signpost | Fairs & Festivals category |
| `galleries.png` | Flowers in pot | Galleries & Studios category |
| `walks.png` | Pine tree | Walks & Trails category |
| `publicart.png` | Deer | Public Art category |
| `performance.png` | Theater stage | Performance Venues category |
| `preservation.png` | Victorian building | Preservation Sites category |
| `badge.png` | Quatrefoil with mountains | Brand mark / watermark |

**Usage rules:**

- **Category cards:** 32x32px inline icons, full opacity within their icon containers
- **Tooltip placeholders:** Full bleed behind tooltip content at 25% opacity when no photo is available
- **Detail panel placeholders:** Full bleed at 40% opacity behind a themed gradient when no photo is available
- **Section watermarks:** Positioned as decorative elements at 4-6% opacity, never competing with content
- **Hero watermark:** Badge at 8% opacity in upper-right corner
- Never crop a watercolor to a circle or geometric mask — let the painted edges breathe
- Never apply filters (saturation boost, contrast adjustment) to watercolors — their muted palette is intentional
- Watercolors are used as fallbacks when real photography is unavailable, not as replacements for photography

#### Photography

- `image_data.json` maps asset names to photo URLs for tooltips and detail panels
- Photos display as cover-fit hero images (280x120px in tooltips, full-width x 180px in detail panel)
- No filters or overlays on photographs — let them speak for themselves
- When no photo exists, the watercolor fallback for that asset's category is used

#### Map Basemap

- **MapLibre (flagship):** MapTiler Landscape — warm, natural terrain colors with topographic detail. Honors the 2019 "quiet graphics" philosophy. Includes 3D terrain exaggeration (2x) with hillshading.
- **Leaflet (fallback):** CartoDB Dark Matter — dark basemap that lets colored markers and gold accents pop. The original design choice.
- **MUSE mode:** MapTiler Landscape remains active but the UI chrome shifts to the MUSE warm cream palette. The terrain provides visual continuity.

### Graphic Elements

#### Textures

- **Noise texture:** SVG-based fractal noise overlay at 1.5-3% opacity, applied to hero, section backgrounds, and parchment areas. Creates a subtle paper/grain quality without using raster images.
- **Gold gradient line:** 1px border-top on hero stats, transitioning from `rgba(200,148,62,0.25)` — the faintest gold wash. Used as a section separator.

#### Animations

- **Scroll-reveal (GSAP):** Elements fade up 30px with 0.8-1s ease timing. Staggered 0.2-0.3s between siblings.
- **Stat counter:** Numbers count up from 0 on scroll intersection. Playfair Display, gold-bright.
- **Marker hover:** CircleMarkers scale to 1.3x with 0.3s cubic-bezier ease.
- **Filter pill active:** Background fills with category color, text inverts to white, subtle lift (-1px translateY), 12px box-shadow.
- **Detail panel:** Slides in from right (-460px to 0) with GSAP. Overlay fades to 50% ink.
- **Corridor panel:** Bottom-left slide-up with 12px translateY to 0, 0.3s ease.
- **Route drawing:** Turf.js `lineSliceAlong` progressive reveal — the route line draws itself along the path over ~3 seconds per segment.
- **Basemap crossfade:** Two tile layers with inverse opacity transitions over 600ms during theme switching.
- **Pulse dot:** Active filter/experience indicator pulses opacity 0.6-1.0 and scale 1.0-1.3 over 2s ease-in-out infinite.
- **Scroll cue:** Vertical gold gradient line (1px wide, 60px tall) with pulse animation. "Explore" text in vertical writing-mode.

**Animation philosophy:** Every animation must serve navigation or comprehension. If removing an animation doesn't reduce usability, remove the animation. The 2019 deck called for "quiet graphics" — that extends to motion.

#### Border / Shadow Language

- **No border-radius anywhere.** All containers, buttons, pills, and cards use sharp corners (border-radius: 0). The only round elements are category dots (50% radius) and corridor stop numbers (50% radius). This is deliberate — sharp edges evoke print/editorial design.
- **Borders:** 1px solid at 6-15% ink opacity for passive containers. Transparent on hover/active (shadow replaces border).
- **Shadows:** `0 4px 24px rgba(26,22,18,0.1)` for lifted cards. `0 8px 32px rgba(0,0,0,0.5)` for tooltips on dark backgrounds. `0 2px 12px` for subtle lift on pills.
- **Color bars:** 3-4px left-side accent bars on cards, using category colors, animated from scaleY(0) on hover.

## Verbal Identity

### Brand Voice Attributes

#### 1. Knowledgeable

**Definition:** We know Nevada County's cultural landscape deeply — the history, the buildings, the people, the stories behind the stories. We speak with earned authority, not assumed expertise.

**Do:**
- "Opened September 11, 1865. Mark Twain, Emma Nevada, and Jack London all performed here. Still operating after 160 years."
- "The Pelton waterwheel was developed and manufactured here in 1878. The double-cupped bucket design revolutionized water power worldwide."
- "Population: handful. Founded during the Gold Rush, nearly abandoned, then reborn as a quiet outpost."

**Don't:**
- "This is one of the most historic buildings in the area!" (vague, unsupported)
- "A must-see for any visitor to Gold Country!" (tourism-brochure generic)
- "Discover the hidden gems of Nevada County!" (clickbait energy)

#### 2. Narrative

**Definition:** We connect facts through story. Every stop on a trail leads to the next through cause and effect, not just geography. We write like a magazine feature, not a database listing.

**Do:**
- "The mine's superintendent needed a home befitting the operation's grandeur..."
- "The building where they forged Pelton wheels now forges community."
- "The gold is gone. What replaced it is better."

**Don't:**
- "Next stop: Miners Foundry. Located at 325 Spring St." (bare directions)
- "See also: North Star Mine Powerhouse, Miners Foundry, Nevada Theatre" (list without logic)
- "This area has many cultural attractions for the whole family." (hollow)

#### 3. Understated

**Definition:** Confidence without chest-beating. We let the facts carry the weight. Strongest statements are shortest. No exclamation points. No superlatives unless they're factually true ("the oldest," "the largest" — with dates).

**Do:**
- "Of 87 emigrants, 48 survived."
- "Still standing."
- "The kind of theater where the projectionist knows your name."

**Don't:**
- "AMAZING cultural experience!!" (never shout)
- "The incredible Nevada Theatre is an absolute must-visit!" (adjective overload)
- "One of the most unique and special places in all of California!" (hyperbolic nonsense)

#### 4. Local

**Definition:** We name things. Streets, buildings, people, dates. Specificity is credibility. We don't generalize about "the area" — we say "Grass Valley" or "the San Juan Ridge" or "Highway 20 east of Nevada City."

**Do:**
- "Wedged into the South Yuba canyon"
- "A.D. Foote" (not "a mine superintendent")
- "1875 schoolhouse on the San Juan Ridge" (not "a historic building in the county")

**Don't:**
- "This part of Northern California" (too vague)
- "The greater Nevada County area" (municipal-speak)
- "A charming Gold Country destination" (tourism-board pablum)

### Tone Variations

| Context | Tone Shift | Example |

### Messaging Architecture

#### Master Narrative

Nevada County is one of the densest concentrations of cultural assets in rural California — 687 places where history, art, food, performance, and landscape intersect. But until now, this wealth has been invisible: scattered across brochures, buried in a gray GIS interface, or simply unknown. The Culture of Gold Country brings it all together in a single interactive map that tells the story of a place where the gold ran out and the culture took over.

### Relationship Rules

**The Culture of Gold Country + Arts Council:**
- The product is endorsed by the Arts Council but has its own visual identity
- Colophon credits: "Data: Nevada County Arts Council" — always attributed
- The Arts Council logo does not appear on the map UI; the quatrefoil badge serves as the heritage mark
- The product can be presented independently (e.g., shared on social media) without the Arts Council logo, but institutional contexts (grant applications, board presentations) should include Arts Council branding

**The Culture of Gold Country + MUSE:**
- Cultural Corridors carry the MUSE sub-brand: "Cultural Corridors / from MUSE '26"
- When a corridor is active, the MUSE theme palette takes over the UI
- The corridor section label uses teal (`#2a8c8c`) and includes a "from MUSE '26" tag
- Curated Experiences (Gold Rush Heritage, Poetry & Performance) do NOT carry MUSE branding — they use the default editorial design
- MUSE theme colors are never used outside of corridor contexts

**Cultural Corridors as sub-brands:**
- Each corridor has its own route color but shares the MUSE theme palette for UI chrome
- Corridors are grouped together in the UI, visually separated from Curated Experiences
- The corridor label format is: "Highway [number]: [Subtitle]" (e.g., "Highway 49: The Arts Trail")

**Curated Experiences as sub-features:**
- Experiences use the default dark editorial design (cream/ink/gold)
- The Gold Rush Heritage Trail has a special MUSE-derived theme for historical reasons (it was the first experience built)
- Future experiences should default to the editorial design unless there's a specific brand tie-in
