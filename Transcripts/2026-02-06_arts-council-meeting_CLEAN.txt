[0.4s] Something is a powerful computer, but that's the trade-off.
[151.6s] It's more like an hour.
[152.6s] It's trash.
[153.6s] Or I did a long time ago, and I'm like, that thing used to last for multiple days.
[163.9s] Yeah, like when it's, mine machine is like not as good like that, but it definitely...
[170.9s] But when I first got it, yeah, it would be like...
[177.1s] Just saying, I'm glad that I got it, like it has a lot of RAM.
[183.9s] Apparently, no one can find anymore.
[185.9s] It's powerful enough that I should be able.
[191.3s] powerful enough that I should just got in a desktop and then gotten an actual laptop that I could.
[195.3s] Oh, you know.
[200.2s] Next time, next purchase.
[202.2s] Exactly. Yeah, I definitely do.
[205.2s] I'm thinking of getting one of those little, like, Mac minis or Mac studios, I think they're called.
[212.9s] Oh.
[213.9s] They're like this big.
[214.9s] People are running their own, like, AI models.
[218.9s] Yeah, it's a security nightmare.
[220.9s] They're getting it all of their information.
[222.9s] And they go out into the world and do things for me.
[224.9s] for M.
[225.9s] Wow.
[226.9s] Same.
[227.9s] Tee bowls.
[228.9s] Yeah, it's probably not the greatest.
[231.9s] Can I get you water or tea?
[233.9s] I would take some, some...
[235.9s] Ooh, water is fine.
[237.9s] Water is good?
[238.9s] Yeah.
[239.9s] But it's well too hot.
[240.9s] So if you're making tea, I'll also just have tea.
[245.9s] Oh, too.
[246.9s] Well, if you're making tea, I'll also just have tea.
[249.9s] How about that?
[251.9s] Well, I mean, it does fundamentally have water.
[253.9s] I'm so curious about how much you should show, but I'm excited about it.
[267.1s] Okay.
[269.1s] Well, I'm a little bit of a question.
[274.1s] Yeah, I, it was a crazy day to say.
[277.1s] Like, so I can do the same demo for you.
[282.1s] Yeah.
[283.1s] I mean, we can just do it online, and then you could see, like, that's what it would be like,
[287.1s] we could do it on your eyes, and we could still, we can sign you up as long, but.
[289.1s] Yeah.
[290.1s] Yeah.
[291.1s] Yeah.
[292.1s] Yeah.
[293.1s] Like the North Star.
[294.1s] You can use that to show that, right?
[296.1s] Or is that like...
[297.1s] I mean, I'm signed up with Claude Code through my own, my own stuff.
[301.1s] But you created a base?
[303.1s] Yeah.
[304.1s] Okay.
[305.1s] Yeah.
[306.1s] I mean, yeah, you could show it that, and that would, you know.
[310.1s] So we have green tea.
[313.1s] We have chamomile, and mint.
[319.1s] I'll just take the basic chamomile.
[324.1s] Okay.
[325.1s] You don't want caffeine?
[328.1s] No, I think I'm having that for the day.
[330.1s] Because she, Eliza has some nice, oh, great.
[333.1s] I'll be all right, thanks.
[335.1s] Okay, I was also wondering, because I was looking up your, the cultural asset map.
[343.1s] Oh.
[344.1s] You do that, right?
[345.1s] We do.
[346.1s] But do you do it?
[348.1s] No.
[349.1s] your, like, thing.
[350.1s] Okay.
[351.1s] Well, like the most...
[352.1s] Okay.
[354.7s] But the thing, so what it is, it's like, it's very heavy on data.
[360.7s] Yeah.
[361.7s] So there's two components, right?
[363.7s] One is to, like, gather data.
[366.7s] And the other one is, um, to, like, put it into the map, which is, like, I think...
[375.7s] And then...
[376.7s] Yeah.
[377.7s] Yeah.
[379.7s] With that now?
[380.7s] Yeah.
[381.7s] But...
[382.7s] Yeah.
[383.7s] But...
[384.7s] Yeah.
[385.7s] I was curious, because I just decided, like, maybe that's something,
[389.7s] maybe that's something, maybe they wanted to change the way it looked,
[393.7s] or they wanted to be able to see how easy it was to add information, or modify something.
[398.7s] We could try.
[400.7s] That would be, like, a pretty cool, I think.
[402.7s] That would be actually a pretty cool.
[404.7s] Right.
[405.7s] I'm so sorry.
[406.7s] broken and we have a...
[408.7s] No.
[409.7s] ...shortage...
[410.7s] ...that cost to offer.
[412.7s] One music that can be...
[415.7s] Does it have to be one for each individual?
[418.7s] I'm so sorry.
[420.7s] I'm sorry.
[421.7s] Is that coming?
[422.7s] Do you guys know if there's any other moms?
[425.7s] This is fine.
[426.7s] I can...
[427.7s] One for me.
[428.7s] Oh, right.
[429.7s] You know what?
[433.7s] I'm just gonna use this.
[435.7s] Yeah.
[438.0s] Well, the tea.
[439.0s] Yeah.
[440.0s] Oh, it's, sorry.
[441.0s] From here, it looks like a kind of like beating over.
[444.0s] What?
[445.0s] It's just a couch.
[447.0s] It's the clean canteen.
[449.0s] It's going to get hard, but I think I can manage.
[452.0s] I'll pull lots of milk in it.
[455.0s] Okay.
[459.7s] Are you ready, Elisa?
[460.7s] Yes.
[461.7s] Coming right off.
[462.7s] Which is chair?
[466.2s] You're in the...
[470.2s] Sorry.
[474.5s] Hey, them.
[475.5s] Yes.
[476.5s] That's right?
[477.5s] Yeah, that's correct.
[478.5s] Yeah.
[479.5s] Gaelic, but my parents did not know that when they named me that.
[483.5s] They just liked the name.
[484.5s] Yeah.
[485.5s] No, what sounds gay-lick.
[492.1s] Yeah, traveling over.
[494.1s] I'm thinking that anthropology is sort of arriving in Scotland
[498.1s] and moving over to Ireland.
[501.1s] Anyway.
[502.1s] I've never been there, but that sounds amazing.
[507.1s] I really want to go to Scotland.
[513.6s] So, how on earth did the Northstone?
[515.6s] after the Northstone find you?
[517.6s] Well, I kind of found them, I guess.
[520.6s] I really, I've been spending the year
[523.6s] really honing a lot of technical skills with AI,
[528.6s] particularly with this one program called Claude Code,
[532.6s] which I know, if we have time,
[534.6s] show you guys kind of a demo of why I feel like it's such a,
[538.6s] I mean, the name, it gets thrown around a lot in AI space,
[541.6s] like a game changer, but it really is quite different
[543.6s] than something like ChatGCT.
[544.6s] much more powerful.
[546.6s] Yeah, but I was...
[547.6s] Yeah, but I was...
[548.6s] Yeah, so limited.
[550.6s] So limited.
[552.6s] Yeah, it's, um, yeah, you have to,
[556.6s] anyway, work over time to prompt it in the right ways.
[560.6s] Yeah, so this I felt like...
[563.6s] Should I turn off, I might turn off some of the leads.
[567.6s] Um, when I really got, you know, to,
[572.5s] into the meat and bones of the program, and I realized,
[575.5s] and I really got,
[576.5s] how much friction it could really remove
[578.5s] from pretty much anything that I wanted to kind of accomplish.
[581.5s] And I started to think, like, well, what do I want to accomplish?
[584.5s] Do I want to build a computer program?
[586.5s] Not necessarily.
[587.5s] I made a few things.
[589.5s] I built some websites.
[590.5s] I helped out my sister by making, like, a CRM piece of software.
[594.5s] But it wasn't really all that gratifying, and I just knew...
[597.5s] Is she in real space?
[598.5s] She is, yeah.
[599.5s] Okay.
[600.5s] Interesting.
[601.5s] Is she using that?
[602.5s] No, she's not.
[603.5s] Ultimately, she ended up switching brokers, and I've got their own.
[605.5s] they got their own thing.
[607.5s] Yeah.
[608.5s] But it just, it was a lot of fun to use.
[611.5s] I found myself using it all the time to learn a variety of things.
[613.5s] And I really just wanted to help out an organization that might have been limited
[619.5s] by wanting to do something good, but not really having the funding or the staffing.
[624.5s] And so nonprofit is what I thought.
[626.5s] It's a delicious challenge.
[628.5s] For good.
[629.5s] Yeah.
[630.5s] Yeah.
[631.5s] And I want to believe that AI can be a good thing.
[633.5s] That's kind of another part of it.
[634.5s] It's like, it's like, it's...
[635.5s] taking people's jobs. I don't really know how things are going to go creatively for
[639.5s] the world now that AI is a big player.
[642.5s] But I do believe that it can be a wonderful source of good by removing so much friction
[648.5s] from just the tedium that goes into any job.
[651.5s] And once that's gone, you actually get time to use your body and your mind to do the things
[656.5s] that AI can't do, have meetings with people.
[660.5s] And let AI record it and give you a summary later if you want to.
[664.5s] But just be more important.
[665.5s] present and more focused on...
[668.5s] Your keypad is changing color.
[672.5s] Is it changing color as you speak or as we speak?
[675.5s] No, that would be horrible.
[677.5s] And I only leave it on because my daughter loves it.
[680.5s] But I'll turn it off with a distraction.
[683.5s] She's two and a couple months.
[685.5s] Oh, sweet.
[686.5s] Yeah, she's fantastic.
[688.5s] But yeah, I saw that.
[689.5s] The North Star House had wanted a grant writer
[691.5s] and was hired trying to find the half-time developer,
[694.5s] and so I just reached out to them.
[695.5s] and let them know.
[696.5s] I don't have experience, but I would like to prove to myself that that might not be as much
[702.5s] of an obstacle as it used to be, because Claude Code is also a wonderful learning tool.
[712.7s] Claude is the overall, do you know what a large language model is?
[716.7s] That's what ChatGPT is.
[718.7s] Yeah.
[719.7s] They're just different ways in which they kind of determine what the next right word is in a sentence.
[725.7s] You know, they're predicted.
[727.7s] So it's...
[728.7s] It's the large language model is called Claude, but the environment that it's in, that you're talking to Claude in, is Claude Code.
[737.7s] And it's, yeah, it's just in the terminal of the computer as opposed to a chat box.
[742.7s] Which might not really make sense, but that's really, like, the main key difference,
[746.2s] and I'll show you why that's different.
[748.7s] So, no, I don't even.
[755.0s] Yeah, but...
[756.0s] To be honest.
[757.0s] I guess the easiest way that I could potentially explain is, like,
[759.0s] if you're using ChatGPT, you're speaking to potentially,
[762.0s] a really knowledgeable friend over email.
[765.0s] They know everything.
[766.0s] They can, you know, make this, give this a completely different tone,
[770.0s] and it gives you a different tone to your whole email.
[772.0s] How do I troubleshoot this application?
[774.0s] It'll find research and give you step by step.
[777.0s] Yeah.
[778.0s] But if you're ever, you know, looking at, okay, what do I need to do now
[782.0s] and going over to your program, what do we need to do now?
[784.0s] You might wish, like, why can't you just do it?
[787.0s] Like, you obviously know how to do it.
[788.0s] Can't you just do it?
[790.0s] And no, because it's not there.
[791.0s] not there, but Claude Code is here.
[793.6s] It's like that knowledgeable friend is actually in the room at your computer.
[798.0s] So if you're like, please, just rearrange the file folder,
[802.0s] please, you know, make this website and update it and do all these things that you would
[806.0s] be telling me to do how to do in ChatGPT.
[809.0s] It will just do.
[810.0s] Closer to you.
[812.0s] So, in other words, say we really did have a folder at Nevada County Arts Council
[818.0s] and I'll share more things.
[821.2s] Arranged it.
[821.7s] according to certain protocols and naming, whatever.
[826.7s] Yeah, and then we could just tell it to do that.
[830.7s] A matter of milliseconds, it would be done.
[832.7s] Oh my God, how is going to love this.
[835.7s] Yeah, yeah.
[836.7s] How, so what's the air margin when you're like,
[844.7s] it's depending on like you're prompting?
[848.7s] It will, if it's going to do something like delete,
[851.7s] you know, and if it's going to be irreversible work.
[853.7s] We could tell it not to delete anything.
[855.7s] Yeah, you can put certain guidelines and parameters on it.
[858.7s] You can go ahead and make it to where it won't do anything
[861.7s] without your express permission.
[862.7s] Like here's what I'm planning to do.
[864.7s] Is this okay?
[865.7s] Yes, enter.
[866.7s] That gets really arduous because it has like 900 steps to take for any one little thing.
[872.7s] But yeah, you can go ahead and write rules if you know
[875.7s] exactly what you don't want to have happen.
[877.7s] But that's kind of difficult to be able to determine every potential
[881.7s] edge case.
[882.7s] Right.
[883.7s] I know that I've been using it for a year and I haven't let it run loose in, you know,
[888.7s] some official database that could really screw things up.
[892.7s] But it hasn't messed anything up for me.
[894.7s] We use workspace.
[896.7s] Like, let's say, I know we're not even quite there yet, but I'm just going to get ahead of myself.
[904.7s] Let's say we're going to start using, like we'll build an account and we're going to start using,
[910.7s] start using, like we get licenses for multiple people.
[915.7s] Would we, would we be doing everything within the platform of cloud,
[921.7s] or would we be connected to it?
[925.7s] Yeah, like, or would we still be working using like workspace and outlook and
[930.7s] It doesn't.
[931.7s] Yeah.
[932.7s] Yeah, it doesn't really take the place of anything.
[935.7s] It's more just anything that you would be doing in Airtable, you know, adding a new record,
[939.7s] with ease.
[940.7s] it will do for you.
[942.7s] And you can actually have air table open right next to it,
[944.7s] and you're prompting Claude code over here,
[946.7s] saying, please change this, and you just see it all moving over there.
[949.7s] At any point in time, you can just delete Claude Code and go back to the
[953.7s] degree that you give it.
[955.7s] To the degree that you give it.
[956.7s] To all the other platforms that were working, which is,
[959.7s] I mean, think of our master password list,
[962.7s] so we'd have to...
[963.7s] Yeah, so it would have access to our entire password list.
[968.7s] The only way you give it.
[969.7s] Right.
[970.7s] Yeah.
[971.7s] Yeah, and it won't, it won't log in automatically, ever, by default.
[975.7s] So it takes time for you to, like, set it up, essentially.
[981.7s] Just give it this handle.
[983.7s] Oh.
[984.7s] Yeah, a little bit.
[985.7s] I've been right into that handle.
[986.7s] No, this is working.
[989.7s] No, it's, we got it.
[991.7s] You noticed.
[992.7s] You noticed.
[993.7s] No, I told the handles are broken.
[997.7s] It's like being broken forever.
[999.7s] Yeah, that kind of thing.
[1004.1s] I haven't actually had to deal with Claude Code in a sensitive environment that really had strict rules.
[1010.1s] I know how to set it up to do that.
[1012.3s] Like, you behave in this way and not that way.
[1014.7s] Right.
[1015.7s] But yeah, it would probably take a little bit of time.
[1017.7s] But I mean, you just, yeah, it would probably, you could say,
[1020.7s] in read only mode, look through this entire database, this entire code base,
[1026.7s] and let us know, yeah, what is that risk of getting damage?
[1028.7s] Yeah.
[1029.7s] if we just let you off the rails.
[1031.2s] I'm thinking of other users, Gian, like, for the longest time,
[1034.7s] especially now, we're going into sort of scarcity.
[1043.8s] Austerity mode.
[1045.8s] I keep saying that as if I'm sort of a chancellor of the extracur of England.
[1049.8s] Anyway, but I keep thinking, I'm like,
[1053.8s] oh, we need to do an audit of all these platforms that we subscribe to.
[1056.8s] Some of them are doing the same thing at the other one.
[1059.8s] Right.
[1060.8s] And we have too many...
[1061.8s] Yeah, like, how many acrobat things do we have?
[1064.8s] Yeah.
[1065.3s] Yeah.
[1066.3s] Yeah.
[1067.3s] So we only have to.
[1068.3s] And I just think we need to run a whole board.
[1071.3s] Yeah.
[1072.3s] Well, the entire stock market right now is running an audit on who wants to invest in what software
[1078.3s] because Claude Code is getting more popular.
[1080.3s] And people are realizing like, oh, I could just build my own CRM, for example, instead of subscribing
[1086.3s] the Monday.
[1087.3s] Instead of being a subscription.
[1088.3s] Yeah.
[1089.3s] So we could...
[1090.3s] That's crazy because then they'll raise the subscription.
[1094.3s] They're gone.
[1095.3s] At that one point.
[1096.3s] Yeah.
[1097.3s] Duolingo is gone.
[1098.3s] There's so many things that it.
[1099.3s] Once you start using it, probably within a week, you're like, oh, yeah, I'm never playing for that again.
[1103.3s] There's no point anymore.
[1105.3s] There will be in everything app soon and put Givila.
[1107.3s] God.
[1108.3s] That's outrageous, isn't it?
[1111.3s] So think about Airtable.
[1112.3s] Think of the many ways that we use Airtable.
[1115.3s] And think of the hours that we have put in through Hanna
[1120.3s] to build different interfaces and...
[1124.3s] So cultural asset math is something that he brought off to me.
[1129.3s] Because he looked at it and he was like...
[1132.3s] Yeah, I was curious what I was going to do for you guys that would be, you know,
[1137.3s] innocuous and not need real access to your data that's publicly available.
[1141.3s] You might want to overhaul in some way, but it's tedious to do so.
[1145.3s] Cloud code seems like it would be a pretty good demo for that.
[1148.3s] We literally have spent...
[1150.3s] Hours, hours, and hours, months, years.
[1153.3s] Yeah.
[1154.3s] Yeah.
[1155.3s] And we don't even stay up to date.
[1158.3s] Yeah.
[1159.3s] Because it's...
[1160.3s] Oh, yeah.
[1161.3s] And the raw son, I sent Gianna to something we'd already spoken about,
[1165.3s] visit Truckeet Tahoe Destination Marketing Organization in the high Sierra,
[1169.3s] and the really cool little agency like Ron,
[1173.3s] with just two pretty coming.
[1175.3s] And then they bought into a sort of AI experience planning thing
[1182.3s] that's now on their site.
[1183.3s] site and it we talk so much about experience planning for the two
[1190.3s] California cultural districts that has been in the county and normally when you build an experience
[1196.3s] it's like you do so really intentionally, you're working with partners, you're like thinking of
[1202.3s] but then we suddenly sort of thought, Jesus, there are people just building experiences with AI.
[1208.3s] On the other hand, you see that AI is not perfect.
[1212.3s] So as Kyle, the communications manager, have you met?
[1217.3s] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1219.3s] So it pointed out, sometimes they're just pulling off the internet,
[1222.3s] and sometimes the information is all.
[1224.3s] The San Francisco S.F. Gate the other day popped up in some social feed of my own,
[1230.3s] like, oh, look, ten things to do in the vast city.
[1233.3s] I could immediately see, look, go on and copy in Curly Hall,
[1236.3s] which hasn't been open for three years.
[1238.3s] Do you know what I mean?
[1239.3s] Yeah.
[1240.3s] So how is Claude?
[1241.3s] Yeah.
[1242.3s] Yeah.
[1244.3s] It was like pre-COVID.
[1245.3s] Yeah.
[1246.3s] That's the thing that, like, it was actually SFGate.
[1251.3s] Interesting.
[1252.3s] Yeah.
[1253.3s] Because their incentive is de-skilling you way in production rather than actually producing
[1258.3s] the product, right?
[1259.3s] So.
[1260.3s] Yeah.
[1261.3s] The big problem is that, like, large-line models don't pull actively off the live internet
[1266.3s] or do things.
[1267.3s] What they do is they have a model that is updated,
[1270.3s] and they have things that crawl the internet to up.
[1271.3s] crawl the internet to update the information.
[1273.3s] Because of that, for instance,
[1275.3s] your information is, depending on what you're talking about,
[1278.3s] always going to be a decent amount, you know, a wide range of out of date.
[1283.3s] And also, it can't create anything that it hasn't already ingested.
[1287.3s] So, because it has no discernment, no ability to relation between something,
[1294.9s] but it's basically a big cell spreadsheet, and you're telling it to find
[1298.9s] the cell equidistant between them.
[1302.9s] So you're not going to find.
[1303.9s] getting anything that's thinking and if I get anything that's
[1307.9s] discernment and you're not getting anything new.
[1310.9s] So you're not getting anything that's the benefits of having a huge, like a different tool
[1324.1s] coming from somewhere else.
[1326.1s] And the cloud error rate is 35%.
[1331.2s] The other problem is...
[1333.2s] So is a code code code is running cloud.
[1337.2s] Yeah, clot is who you're talking to, yeah.
[1340.2s] You have a program on your computer.
[1341.2s] Yeah.
[1342.2s] that would you go to the website and you have.
[1345.2s] The other problem that people have with these kind of like coding platforms
[1356.3s] is that if you don't have any understanding of how the actual code works,
[1360.3s] because I used to be a liaison between, like when I did U.S. work,
[1366.7s] between the tech team of programmers and all that stuff,
[1370.7s] and then like from end, which is a labrun.
[1373.7s] And one of the big things that you do,
[1376.7s] are a programmer, a code, or you're doing with those things,
[1379.7s] is you make a programmer.
[1380.7s] things more efficient, right?
[1382.7s] And fundamentally, Claude or Claude code can't do that, right?
[1386.7s] Because it's not a thinking thing.
[1388.7s] It can take spits of code, but it doesn't, I don't know which code is the best code,
[1393.7s] and puts them together.
[1395.7s] So you get these programs...
[1396.7s] Well, it doesn't it know.
[1398.7s] Because it doesn't have to assume.
[1400.7s] It has not a brain.
[1401.7s] It doesn't have...
[1402.7s] But it can follow best practices.
[1404.7s] Anything that you can look online to be like,
[1406.7s] what would make good code, it can read that, and apply it.
[1409.7s] it?
[1410.7s] No, because it doesn't understand...
[1412.7s] So it takes something like,
[1419.4s] there's a reason for this is with their AI tripment,
[1425.4s] they kept getting all these things about the foundation
[1430.4s] that wasn't, hadn't been around for 10 years.
[1433.4s] Yeah.
[1434.4s] The reason that kept coming up is because the frequency of articles
[1438.4s] that it had crawled that exists within its light of model
[1443.4s] is higher than the frequency of other things.
[1446.4s] So it's all it knows is this is bigger,
[1449.4s] and so it includes faster.
[1451.4s] So there's no actual plot husband.
[1453.4s] It doesn't understand the term best practices.
[1456.4s] But what it can do is it can take the key with best practices
[1459.4s] and try and associate that with something.
[1462.4s] So you'll get an association and might work at my mouth.
[1464.4s] So like, let's say cultural asset now.
[1467.4s] Like where, like, how would, like, how would, like, how would Claude
[1473.4s] code be useful. Like, for instance,
[1477.4s] in something that's like, we don't even have a person that can do
[1481.4s] the amount of, like, data that it's required, and,
[1485.4s] like, updating it in a constant basis and the way
[1489.4s] that the navigation is right now, like, could it be more user-friendly?
[1493.4s] Like, how could it...
[1495.4s] Well, that's kind of one of the things that I find AI would be really helpful for
[1499.4s] is, yeah, one, not ever trusting any of the information that it gives you,
[1503.4s] unless you explicitly give it the information and then talk about that.
[1508.4s] You know, don't rely on it to go out there and pull in relevant stuff.
[1513.4s] I have mine connected through an API to a web browser called Perplexity.
[1519.4s] Have you heard of that? Use that?
[1521.4s] It's pretty nice.
[1523.4s] It will, you know, scrape the web and assimilate the information.
[1526.4s] And yeah, you have to rely on its summary, but at least puts sources right next to it.
[1530.4s] Like this is what it's saying.
[1532.4s] Here, you can click on it.
[1533.4s] on it and verify that's the website that it came from.
[1536.4s] Whether you trust that website, you know, you're going down a rabbit hole on that front.
[1539.4s] Right.
[1540.4s] But you at least know that you can see the research that it's reading to come up
[1544.4s] with the answers that it's giving you.
[1546.4s] You know, it's not just hallucinating something.
[1548.4s] Do you want to show it?
[1553.2s] Is there a lot?
[1554.2s] Sure.
[1555.2s] Yeah, we could do a little quick brainstorm right now if you want.
[1560.2s] But yeah, use it to brainstorm what you could potentially do with something that you know exists.
[1565.2s] that you know exists.
[1566.2s] You know you're both looking at the same thing.
[1569.2s] And yeah, just having it kind of asked questions.
[1572.2s] Not something that I really like about,
[1574.2s] because it draws out of you as a human,
[1577.2s] instead of coming up and being your friend.
[1581.2s] So I already had it, yeah,
[1589.0s] who's the primary audience for whatever we build
[1592.0s] with this cultural asset map?
[1593.0s] I just kind of wanted to see what would we do with it?
[1595.0s] That's the same exact question.
[1596.0s] What would you do with this?
[1598.0s] with this cultural asset.
[1600.0s] Let's ask me, who's the primary audience for whatever we build
[1603.0s] with this virtual asset and data?
[1605.0s] Probably all of those.
[1609.0s] I was going to just view for the demo.
[1612.0s] Okay, thank you.
[1613.0s] Yeah, okay.
[1614.0s] So you answer that question.
[1616.0s] And that's all it wants to do.
[1619.0s] Oh, you know what? Am I even online?
[1623.6s] Probably not.
[1625.6s] It's the CBCI Arts.
[1628.6s] Okay.
[1629.6s] see one?
[1630.6s] Yep.
[1631.6s] Oh.
[1632.6s] There, I didn't see one about that.
[1633.6s] Oh.
[1634.6s] I think that one would work.
[1635.6s] Okay.
[1636.6s] Yeah.
[1637.6s] I never know the difference, actually.
[1639.6s] This one that's just called CDC.
[1641.6s] This one is the 5G.
[1643.6s] So it's enlightened.
[1645.6s] Capital E, isn't it?
[1648.6s] No.
[1649.6s] No.
[1650.6s] Okay.
[1651.6s] 530 with like the ED at the end.
[1655.6s] Enlightened.
[1657.6s] 530.
[1658.6s] zero.
[1663.9s] It's a very outdated password.
[1666.9s] Yeah.
[1667.9s] What was the thing that you had to do something
[1685.8s] in struggling to read your
[1687.8s] eyesight?
[1688.8s] Right before I got here, it was the
[1691.8s] last thing I did before I left, this kind of
[1693.8s] spur of the moment, was how to it
[1695.8s] do its best to scrape what you already have for the
[1698.8s] cultural asset map, really pull down all the
[1700.8s] up local folder, which I believe that it did.
[1703.8s] And then I'm asking you because I didn't really know what to do
[1706.8s] with it.
[1707.8s] What do we do with it?
[1708.8s] And so now it's kind of helping us figure out,
[1710.8s] well, what, yeah, what do you want to do with this?
[1712.8s] With the cultural asset map.
[1715.8s] Oh, good.
[1716.8s] Yeah, saying do you want to be an active map rebuild,
[1718.8s] take the same data,
[1719.8s] do you build the map and scrap,
[1721.8s] so you pull the data from the existing data that it exists,
[1725.8s] and then you can create potentially
[1728.8s] like a different way to present it.
[1730.8s] Yeah, if you want to just see,
[1731.8s] you want to do like a user interest
[1733.8s] remodel, like just check a different thing if you want to.
[1736.8s] Yeah.
[1737.8s] Yeah.
[1738.8s] Yeah.
[1739.8s] Yeah.
[1740.8s] Yeah.
[1741.8s] Oh, my God.
[1746.6s] I know.
[1751.3s] So one of the cool things about Claude Code that makes it different from ChatGPT is you can download
[1764.1s] things called skill.
[1766.1s] And they are like just a list of prompts, like best practices, you know, how to interpret the data
[1773.1s] and then applies certain tried and true methods of user interface rules.
[1779.1s] And it's just similar.
[1780.1s] somewhere in the direction.
[1782.1s] Yeah, really, really easy to find and install.
[1785.1s] So it's the same thing as us saying, but, you know,
[1789.1s] five times more effective, as us saying to chat.
[1793.1s] Oh, wow.
[1794.1s] We want you to put your lawyer hat on, you know.
[1797.1s] Yeah.
[1798.1s] Do we want gold country heritage?
[1801.1s] No.
[1802.1s] Queen, modern, minimal, probably.
[1803.1s] Or bold editorial.
[1806.1s] I mean, it's just a demo.
[1808.1s] A bold editorial.
[1809.1s] Yeah.
[1809.6s] Yeah, whatever you think is going to be like, the most visually impressive.
[1814.6s] And they, if you have a Mac, they have this, this whole user interface.
[1821.6s] You all have Macs.
[1823.6s] Okay.
[1824.6s] They have something called Claude Co-pilot that's a lot prettier to look at.
[1827.6s] And I think it's more or less the same thing underneath the hood.
[1830.6s] This puts a lot of people off.
[1832.6s] They don't even try, even though it is kind of close to the same.
[1835.6s] It's like talking to it through the command line.
[1837.6s] It looks horrifying.
[1838.6s] coding.
[1839.6s] Yeah.
[1840.6s] I'm like, I don't, stop.
[1842.8s] We're all very aesthetic.
[1845.8s] So if you're doing that thing, it might take a minute.
[1849.8s] We could talk about other stuff, or we could just watch,
[1852.8s] you could just be fascinated by the, you know, the decision-making process, as you can see it.
[1857.8s] You're not talking to it's sort, because you've told it to...
[1859.8s] It's kind of letting...
[1860.8s] It's kind of letting...
[1861.8s] ...the skills that you've invited into the group.
[1866.8s] Yeah, and it's showing you the commands that it's actually running on the computer,
[1869.8s] which, you know, you can ask it at any point in time,
[1872.8s] you just hit escape, it'll stop its dating process.
[1874.8s] Like, what does bash CPC users under blah, blah, blah, what does that mean?
[1878.8s] Well, it'll tell you what it feels.
[1880.8s] But it's basically just running the same commands that are the result of you going and clicking on something.
[1887.8s] Yeah.
[1888.8s] You should show Eliza, too, like how you put the data for the news and that photo that you sent me.
[1895.8s] Oh, yeah.
[1896.8s] That, I was like, fabulous.
[1898.8s] like that's fascinating by that.
[1900.8s] Because that literally looks like a table where you have tags and
[1906.8s] loves or lies, and I think I
[1910.8s] I pulled something else cool from the Arts Council too,
[1914.8s] and I don't, I'm constantly adding to the database
[1918.8s] and I haven't quite taken all the time to really get it, like,
[1921.8s] really beautiful, because, you know, I've imported it in bulk
[1925.8s] and you haven't really gone through it.
[1927.8s] But did I pull?
[1929.8s] Yeah.
[1934.0s] So yeah, this was really easy to find for at least in Nevada County Arts Council,
[1938.0s] 2014 annual report, PDF.
[1940.0s] I don't know that I could have done that with Muse.
[1944.0s] I actually had to pull it up and then, you know,
[1947.0s] just screenshot, page 4, screenshot, you know, 30 times.
[1950.0s] Yeah.
[1951.0s] I just think we have, oh no.
[1954.0s] It's amazing.
[1955.0s] It's different than the PDF.
[1957.0s] Exactly.
[1958.0s] Yeah.
[1959.0s] But then with this one, it found this on here.
[1960.0s] and then it just used something called PDF scale,
[1963.0s] which I don't even remember downloading,
[1964.0s] and it just turned it into the PDF.
[1967.0s] So I don't know if you guys have this publicly available online.
[1971.0s] It is.
[1972.0s] Okay.
[1973.0s] But is it through Issuu or the actual PDF?
[1975.0s] Okay, well then maybe it just found that.
[1977.0s] That's why, yeah.
[1978.0s] I do that intentionally,
[1980.0s] because Issuu, all those things have from people.
[1984.0s] They can be annoying to read.
[1986.0s] You realize for some people, they look cute, but totally.
[1989.0s] Yeah.
[1990.0s] So we tried on our reports page.
[1991.0s] We don't know that.
[1992.0s] Yeah.
[1993.0s] That's a nice thing.
[1995.0s] Down here, you can see how much room you have left in the conversation.
[2001.0s] When you run out the room in the conversation, and as you get closer to the end, you'll see it starts
[2006.0s] not do as good of a job.
[2008.0s] It's having to remember every single thing that came up.
[2012.0s] This is, it's new.
[2014.0s] It's crack at it, or at least it's building it currently.
[2018.0s] Wow.
[2018.5s] doesn't look like it's done anything actually yet.
[2021.5s] And it might just be showing...
[2024.5s] I'd be surprised if it's actually fully interactive and not just like...
[2029.5s] Aesthetic thing.
[2030.5s] Yes, exactly.
[2031.5s] Right.
[2032.5s] But that would be something that you could then do.
[2035.5s] So when are you going to come and work with us?
[2039.5s] We can definitely talk about it.
[2042.5s] I'm not officially employed at the North Starts yet.
[2045.5s] I submitted a proposal for something.
[2047.5s] I mean, it's so hard this ethics thing with AI,
[2054.4s] because you could be like a wonderful, brilliant person sitting there
[2058.4s] just grabbing everyone's stuff from everywhere to benefit one organization.
[2063.4s] Like, where are the principles and principles, ways of working with AI?
[2069.4s] Do you know what you mean?
[2071.4s] You mean, like, could you just counterfeit someone else's whole shit?
[2075.4s] Right, right.
[2076.4s] Yeah.
[2077.4s] I mean, I don't know, and I don't know what the software industry.
[2082.4s] They don't have any real recourse where it's like,
[2084.4s] oh, you just created another duolingo.
[2086.4s] You didn't patent being able to translate things in a certain educational way.
[2091.4s] I don't know it.
[2093.4s] Yeah.
[2096.7s] Yeah.
[2099.0s] Okay.
[2100.0s] Oh, wow.
[2101.0s] Oh, my God.
[2102.0s] I love it.
[2103.0s] Right, but I don't know that it actually, oh, it did do something.
[2106.0s] It might be doing more.
[2108.0s] It might be, because, of course, there's a letter.
[2110.0s] Of course, there's a legend.
[2111.0s] There are different categories.
[2112.0s] There are different layers.
[2113.0s] So it's probably probably like that.
[2115.0s] I think it's not finished, is it?
[2118.0s] Well, I don't know that it had any intention of really doing it, but at least the markers are there.
[2124.0s] So, interesting.
[2126.0s] Yeah, you could say.
[2128.0s] So if you click on the Eden, okay, yeah.
[2131.0s] Hang on, let me, if, here's a good opportunity for you to say, it's good, but, and then see what actually happens.
[2137.0s] Okay.
[2138.0s] So what would you want?
[2139.0s] What would you want?
[2140.0s] Where are the interactive links?
[2141.0s] Yeah.
[2145.9s] Also, do you guys use?
[2146.9s] Visual and visual differentiation between categories.
[2151.9s] Yes, yes, yes.
[2153.9s] Visual differentiation between categories and like color coded or something.
[2157.9s] Either if you have a speech to text thing on your computers?
[2165.6s] I know it wouldn't really make sense in an environment this close,
[2168.6s] but when you're working at home or something, it's so nice to not have to type.
[2173.6s] So it might run out of rooms soon here and then have to come pack.
[2183.6s] For a while that was a big call.
[2186.6s] Every time it had to come packed.
[2188.6s] It would have to summarize everything.
[2190.6s] Yeah, every new model that comes out is a little bit better.
[2193.6s] So how would that, like, going back to the map, the website.
[2198.6s] So that's like, it created a website.
[2202.6s] This is, well, it's, you could deploy this.
[2205.6s] I could go ahead and say, like, Vercel is kind of a website.
[2209.6s] Right, it's a page on a website.
[2211.6s] Yeah, very, very easily.
[2212.6s] And I would just type into Claude Code, deploy this,
[2215.6s] and then it would be a link, and then you could go to it on your thumb.
[2218.6s] Like, actually make accessible to other people who aren't.
[2221.6s] Right now, it's just on my computer.
[2224.6s] Got it.
[2225.6s] But yeah, you could just say, hey, ClaudeCode.
[2227.6s] It could be like.
[2229.6s] Yeah.
[2230.6s] Can we go back and.
[2231.6s] Can we go back and.
[2232.6s] real quick.
[2233.6s] Yeah.
[2234.6s] What do you want?
[2235.6s] Just look at the top.
[2236.6s] I just want to see what they created.
[2238.6s] Like the whole interfaite, like the entire thing.
[2243.6s] So six, so it pulled that we have 685 assets.
[2249.6s] It's funny.
[2250.6s] I thought we have over a thousand.
[2251.6s] You might.
[2252.6s] You know, all I did was say, do your best job scraping this.
[2255.6s] I didn't verify it at all.
[2257.6s] And like Kyle's saying, you can't just trust it.
[2259.6s] You have to always be the human in the loop.
[2261.6s] You have to know.
[2262.6s] what, generally what you're going for, so you can actually verify.
[2266.6s] Yeah.
[2267.6s] So if you click in each of those categories up there.
[2271.6s] Yeah.
[2272.6s] Or like up, if you go up.
[2275.6s] And click on.
[2276.6s] Yeah.
[2277.6s] Click on those to see where.
[2279.6s] It's just showing you.
[2280.6s] And it does look like they are color coded to degree.
[2283.6s] But also, I don't think it's hot swapping yet.
[2285.6s] But also, I don't think it's hot swap yet.
[2288.6s] So let me see.
[2291.6s] Which I'm not sure.
[2292.6s] like actually taking the changes we just asked it to make and reload it over here.
[2301.6s] You're right.
[2306.7s] Yeah.
[2307.7s] You don't have to take the page down or take the three down and you can make the update.
[2314.7s] Okay.
[2315.7s] So is it like you did the back end, the square space?
[2318.7s] Did it have this before or is that?
[2321.7s] Date us?
[2323.7s] I don't know.
[2324.7s] I don't think we went down.
[2325.7s] I mean, I recognize the, well, how this person, what's that?
[2330.7s] So that must...
[2332.7s] They do like the love.
[2333.7s] They're new.
[2334.7s] I mean, they're still here, I think.
[2336.7s] They're just over somewhere else?
[2339.7s] Oh, it's...
[2340.7s] Well, it's...
[2341.7s] It's...
[2342.7s] Well, but it is in our cultural, I ask them now.
[2345.7s] Yes, this is because if you call daughter of the website,
[2348.7s] that's the old one.
[2350.7s] Yeah.
[2351.7s] But that's okay.
[2354.1s] So now they're outer heaven at seven.
[2356.1s] Outer Heaven.
[2357.1s] That's what it is, yeah.
[2359.1s] Okay, so it did, it made some changes.
[2362.1s] It updated them.
[2363.1s] I don't know if it's completely done yet, but...
[2366.1s] I mean, it looks great.
[2368.1s] Everyone would love this.
[2370.1s] So, can you click?
[2372.1s] Now you can click on.
[2374.1s] That's...
[2376.1s] Imagine if we showed up and shared those...
[2379.1s] Right, it's the experience planning.
[2381.1s] That would be like...
[2384.5s] Oh, could you ask it to do something?
[2387.5s] I want you to...
[2388.5s] find a photo for every single data point,
[2391.5s] find an image that can be paired
[2394.5s] with the data points.
[2396.5s] Yeah.
[2397.5s] Because so, for example,
[2399.5s] we've been literally stuck on this for so long,
[2403.5s] because imagine I'm trying to find a thousand images.
[2407.5s] This would be kind of like what Lynn was proposing
[2411.5s] that visit with it.
[2414.5s] What I would call that platform that was talking about?
[2417.5s] I am.
[2418.5s] Like, he could probably build a visit widget platform.
[2425.5s] But, like, it's not like he's asking to source out data.
[2429.5s] Like, we have that data.
[2432.5s] And what he's doing is building the interface.
[2435.5s] That's exactly.
[2436.5s] Yeah.
[2437.5s] So, if you were to look at this and really start drilling down,
[2440.5s] you would find more and more things that are off about it,
[2443.5s] and you would have to have a conversation,
[2445.5s] an interactive conversation in which you're really looking,
[2447.5s] really looking to really make sure that it did what it said it did.
[2451.5s] Does it run out of energy because of the level of subscription?
[2455.5s] No, I mean, yes, there is a certain amount of quota that you can, you know,
[2459.5s] the amount of time that you can interact with the thing.
[2462.5s] Yeah, right, yeah.
[2468.5s] Compute time, how they do it, so time and process are to sort of
[2474.5s] because these things are incredibly computing.
[2476.5s] compute intensive.
[2478.5s] Yeah.
[2479.5s] Yeah.
[2480.5s] It's shocking.
[2481.5s] Right, right.
[2482.5s] That makes it.
[2484.5s] So I think it would be cancer.
[2486.5s] It is awful, isn't it?
[2488.5s] We really are literally,
[2490.5s] dooming ourselves, aren't we?
[2492.5s] Yeah.
[2493.5s] You're a cancer race in St. Louis,
[2495.5s] not 10 times because there's
[2498.5s] carotics and they're really awesome.
[2500.5s] Are you serious?
[2501.5s] Yeah, because they can
[2502.5s] skirt the laws,
[2504.5s] what would be like,
[2505.5s] like if you do find images for all 685, but do you want to get like 10?
[2512.5s] Yeah.
[2513.5s] Yeah.
[2514.5s] Do you have ones that you want to see?
[2516.5s] Or just maybe like, let's go to the
[2520.5s] categories and see the numbers.
[2522.5s] Categories, like if you go up, let's go
[2526.5s] something low, like preservation.
[2527.5s] Something low, yeah.
[2529.5s] Okay, so the prompt that you're looking for is see if you can find
[2533.5s] images that would pair well with a little.
[2534.5s] would pair well with the preservation and culture category, landmarks.
[2541.5s] Yeah, we could just experiment.
[2542.5s] Maybe you can even ask for like half of it, you know.
[2546.5s] Well, yeah, let's say 10.
[2548.5s] 10 from preservation and culture.
[2549.5s] Maybe public art would be an easy one to experiment with because
[2553.5s] there might be more images.
[2555.5s] Yeah.
[2556.5s] Yeah.
[2557.5s] Yeah.
[2559.5s] Okay.
[2560.5s] Yeah.
[2561.5s] See if you can identify
[2563.5s] identify 15, which one?
[2568.5s] Public Art.
[2569.5s] Images of the public art landscape, or landmarks.
[2574.5s] Yeah, using the perplexity browser skill.
[2577.5s] I'm actually talking to it right now.
[2579.5s] So using the complexity browser skill, and then how did you want it to actually display images?
[2584.5s] Like when you hover over the actual?
[2587.5s] Yes.
[2588.5s] Yeah.
[2589.5s] When you hover over the data point on the map, find an appropriate image to also show
[2593.5s] in the pop-up model as a result of it does.
[2598.9s] And this is a, this will show you how it actually will go and find,
[2603.9s] also it doesn't, you know, you don't need to be clear in your prompt.
[2606.9s] That's a mess.
[2607.9s] It'll, it'll figure it out.
[2608.9s] I was wondering that.
[2609.9s] Yeah.
[2610.9s] Yeah.
[2611.9s] Yeah.
[2612.9s] Because I don't recognize yours, so that's full of numbers.
[2615.9s] Well, I think yours should be in there too.
[2617.9s] Yeah, I think it read everything.
[2619.9s] But yeah, now it will open up.
[2623.9s] open up a browser which will navigate to perplexity,
[2627.9s] which is my favorite web research tool,
[2631.9s] and it will run the search,
[2634.9s] and then it will grab its search and pull it in
[2638.9s] instead of using its own internal web searching model,
[2641.9s] which is really not to be trusted.
[2644.9s] He's right about that.
[2645.9s] It's really outdated.
[2646.9s] It doesn't often even know what day it is.
[2648.9s] So it thinks...
[2649.9s] What is not to be trusted?
[2651.9s] When you ask, like, Claude Code or chat,
[2653.9s] directly like, tell me, what's the, you know, the, you know, the most current information.
[2658.9s] So you'll also be able to do an active web search today right now.
[2663.9s] Okay.
[2664.9s] Yeah.
[2665.9s] So it'll pull it up.
[2667.9s] There's perplexity, AI.
[2669.9s] And yeah, this is another one that is great when it's free.
[2677.6s] It's, you know, it's great when it's paid.
[2679.6s] But I don't really use Google so much anymore because you don't have to deal with, like,
[2684.6s] excepting.
[2685.6s] all being bombarded by advertisements and stuff.
[2689.6s] It just gives me the information in a really interesting way.
[2692.6s] So yeah, it's doing its search them.
[2700.3s] It's doing fine, Claude.
[2702.3s] It's doing fine.
[2703.3s] It just came out with a new model yesterday
[2709.5s] down here, Obis 4.6.
[2712.5s] So there's some cool new features that I don't know about yet.
[2716.5s] It might do a better job than I expect it to.
[2718.5s] It might do a worse job on something.
[2720.5s] But it's doing its thing.
[2723.5s] Oh, look.
[2724.5s] It's mild.
[2725.5s] We can let it do that and talk in the meantime, or we can just have this particular meeting be all about Claude Code if you guys want.
[2738.3s] I mean, I think you wanted to get also like with your head, North Star House hat on.
[2746.3s] Yeah.
[2747.3s] Right?
[2748.3s] Yeah, back to the kind of the intro is, yeah, I'm new to grant writing.
[2753.3s] I'm new to the nonprofit space.
[2754.3s] to the nonprofit space in general.
[2755.9s] I've never worked with a board before
[2759.3s] and trying to figure out what to do.
[2763.2s] Yeah, like what direction the North Star House wants to go in
[2766.6s] and what grants to apply for.
[2769.3s] And they're kind of in the same boat too.
[2771.6s] You know, there is nobody there that can say,
[2773.2s] like, here's the databases we want you to access.
[2775.8s] Here's the grants in general that we want you to apply for.
[2778.8s] Here's a good definition of done.
[2780.2s] Do this through that.
[2781.2s] It's completely tough to me to turn this from the ground up.
[2784.3s] and so yeah, but my understanding.
[2789.3s] I do, I do write, yeah.
[2792.3s] What do write?
[2793.3s] Oh, I'm just journal entries.
[2796.3s] I see.
[2797.3s] Yes, no, I don't, yeah, write for any publications.
[2799.3s] Right.
[2800.3s] I'm just curious, I'm trying to fill my way to see how fast we can know.
[2809.2s] We applied, or I applied to the,
[2812.2s] actually I don't even know how to pronounce it,
[2814.2s] Pichit, background.
[2816.2s] Oh, the foundation, Titchard,
[2819.2s] Foundation. I don't know how to pronounce it.
[2823.2s] Yeah, let me pull it up.
[2824.2s] It's that foundation.
[2825.2s] It's some German, doesn't it?
[2827.2s] T-E-I.
[2828.2s] That Tide Church Foundation.
[2830.2s] Yeah.
[2831.2s] It's this one here.
[2833.2s] Yeah.
[2834.2s] And so I apply it to that one.
[2837.2s] And you could read the narrative if you, if you want on that,
[2841.2s] but I'm not, I'm not necessarily
[2843.2s] different brand,
[2845.2s] necessarily.
[2846.2s] And then you used, did you completely use,
[2848.2s] completely use AI to write the application?
[2852.2s] I mean, as well as having multiple meetings,
[2855.2s] developer meetings with Haley and the North Star House in general,
[2858.2s] and you know, recording the transcript of the meetings
[2861.2s] and letting that inform it.
[2863.2s] Yes, yes.
[2864.2s] Yeah, but if we had to add new things,
[2867.2s] we just had a pilot day for their board game night,
[2871.2s] and it was kind of one of the pillars of the whole family discovery days
[2874.2s] program that were sort of pitching and hoping to get funded,
[2878.2s] by, as a result of this, high shirt,
[2881.2s] I'm just pronounced, grants.
[2884.2s] So once we got the board game data for that,
[2887.2s] then yes, I pulled it in, and I just asked AI,
[2889.2s] like, where could you incorporate this into the narrative?
[2892.2s] And then you read it, and if it's good, then it goes.
[2895.2s] But no, I didn't just let it go off and write it completely.
[2899.2s] And I actually find that the Ask User Question tool
[2904.2s] that you saw earlier when I was answering questions
[2907.2s] is the absolute best.
[2908.2s] best way to write anything with AI,
[2910.2s] because it'll just show you the sentence that it's proposing.
[2913.2s] It looks like four different avenues that maybe you want to go.
[2916.2s] Is it too formal?
[2917.2s] Is it too blah, blah, blah, and you just click that,
[2919.2s] or type your own thing and just kind of riff off of it
[2922.2s] and you collaborate on building it sentence by sentence
[2925.2s] instead of letting it do it on its own.
[2928.2s] I find that chat does that as well.
[2932.2s] Chat can be so effusive and emotional and sentimental.
[2937.7s] Yeah, almost all first drafts are.
[2939.7s] terrible.
[2940.7s] Which I'm sickened by.
[2941.7s] Yeah.
[2942.7s] I feel like a sociopath when I'm working with chat because I don't want any of that.
[2949.7s] I don't want any of that.
[2950.7s] I don't want any of that at all.
[2951.7s] And when you're, particularly when you're applying for a foundation,
[2954.7s] I think it's probably tight-cutting.
[2956.7s] Yeah, that's awesome.
[2958.7s] That's how it's pretty much.
[2959.7s] Yeah.
[2960.7s] But I'm completely sure.
[2963.7s] It's one of those very visually memorable words.
[2967.7s] So, like, um,
[2968.7s] I think you're also trying to understand like,
[2973.7s] because there has been no programming at the North Star House, right?
[2978.7s] Basically nothing.
[2980.7s] Like the other people are going and doing, right?
[2984.7s] So I know one of the questions they had for me is like,
[2988.7s] is this something that the board,
[2991.7s] I think you said that this is something that the board wants
[2994.7s] to start implementing is like programming.
[2997.7s] Actual public face.
[2998.7s] programming.
[2999.7s] Community engagement.
[3000.7s] Yeah.
[3001.7s] In the category of the arts.
[3002.7s] And right now, like running board game,
[3005.7s] it was just to see what it's like to reach out to the community
[3008.7s] and see if anybody showed up.
[3009.7s] Did they like it?
[3010.7s] You know, what?
[3011.7s] Did they?
[3012.7s] Yeah, actually.
[3013.7s] 30 people showed up and they wanted another one.
[3015.7s] Yeah.
[3018.6s] Yeah.
[3019.6s] Yeah.
[3020.6s] Yeah.
[3022.6s] But I mean, when it comes to the California Arts Council grants,
[3025.6s] they require two years of programming, right?
[3028.6s] Yeah.
[3029.6s] Yeah.
[3030.6s] I was going to ask, one of the questions I was going to ask,
[3033.6s] what has happened in the past?
[3034.6s] What have you particularly done with the North Star House that might count?
[3038.6s] Or does just docent tours with like some tiny creative element,
[3042.6s] like reading a letter or having it.
[3045.6s] It's in process.
[3047.6s] So have you had any other good events connected with arts and cross movement?
[3064.9s] It's connected with arts and cross movement.
[3065.9s] It's very much humanities.
[3067.9s] There's a lot of story around the North Star.
[3070.9s] Julia Morgan, you know, we wrote a, you've probably seen it.
[3074.9s] Yeah.
[3075.9s] Sweet.
[3076.9s] And actually Kyle wrote that.
[3077.9s] I saw that, yeah.
[3078.9s] Kyle's, um,
[3080.9s] Paul Kyle, because he actually wrote something much deeper and more beautiful.
[3084.9s] And it had to be truncated.
[3086.9s] We had to truncated.
[3087.9s] And it was just awful because he really did write it beautifully.
[3091.9s] And he, Kyle's really wrote beautifully.
[3094.9s] And he, and he, and he,
[3095.9s] He's a beautiful writer.
[3096.9s] Anyway, we should, it would be lovely for you to share that with another stuff.
[3101.9s] Yeah, it's okay.
[3102.9s] We actually should, um, one thing I was thinking, too, is like,
[3106.9s] we should, we need to reach out to the advertisers and all the people that are mentioned.
[3112.9s] Yeah.
[3113.9s] Not only dropping them copies, but like, yes,
[3117.9s] sending it to them.
[3118.9s] And I know the Twin Pine Lakes, remember they asked us to send it to them.
[3124.9s] Yeah.
[3125.9s] Endowment for the humanities?
[3127.9s] C-E-H or?
[3128.9s] I know.
[3129.9s] No, it's just called collaborating humanities.
[3132.9s] Okay.
[3133.9s] I think it's got it's so long since.
[3135.9s] We've been funded by any of course.
[3137.9s] To who?
[3138.9s] By who?
[3139.9s] Oh, yeah.
[3140.9s] Um, so.
[3142.9s] Do they require...
[3143.9s] Is that a grant or just the funder in general?
[3145.9s] It's, it's...
[3146.9s] They are the funder.
[3148.9s] They are the funder.
[3149.9s] I'm going to tell you which one.
[3151.9s] So basically, if you think of humanities in relation
[3154.9s] to the North Star,
[3155.9s] House.
[3156.9s] So with California Arts Council, we're going to want you to come up with some
[3161.9s] mesmerizing project that can be implemented.
[3165.9s] It was, but it's back on.
[3167.9s] Okay.
[3168.9s] It's back on.
[3169.9s] It can be implemented through multiple equity lenses,
[3174.9s] which are almost impossible to achieve,
[3176.9s] other than the fact that we are in a deeply rural space.
[3179.9s] Whatever you do, build upon the fact that we're deeply rural.
[3183.9s] And underserved.
[3184.9s] served and in a region that, you know, we're at any minute prone to wildfire and, you know, use like disaster.
[3198.9s] Perigial ecology.
[3199.9s] Yeah.
[3200.9s] Also that it's keenly of interest to you, the North Star House, that you are reaching deep into underrepresented, previous,
[3213.9s] historically underrepresented.
[3214.9s] representative populations, that's always going to be a, give you an edge with the California
[3219.3s] Arts Council. With California Humanities, Humanities being about storytelling.
[3226.9s] Oops.
[3227.9s] Oh my gosh.
[3228.9s] It's, it's, they're equally hard to get all grants are very hard to get.
[3234.9s] But California Humanities may give you an opportunity to support community to support community engagement.
[3243.9s] community engagement that needs to come from the North Star House and pulling people towards it.
[3248.9s] It's just got such a rich history.
[3251.4s] Just when I looked at Carl's first run, you know, the one that we would have done if we had more space.
[3258.9s] Yeah.
[3259.9s] It's just so interesting.
[3261.9s] So California Humanity is really looking to their grounds.
[3264.9s] I'm just pulling that up.
[3265.9s] You know someone really good to pull some history from around the North Star House is Hillary Hodge.
[3272.9s] You know?
[3273.9s] Yeah.
[3274.9s] Yeah.
[3275.9s] Yeah.
[3276.9s] Yeah.
[3277.9s] She...
[3278.9s] Clear history in reverse.
[3279.9s] She was talking about.
[3280.9s] It would be interesting.
[3281.9s] Exactly.
[3282.9s] Yeah.
[3283.9s] Humanities for all, we've had a humanities for all graph,
[3288.9s] but there are a storytelling that we did around it.
[3291.9s] Are they, there are 5,000?
[3294.9s] This one was 20 that we got.
[3296.9s] Oh, okay.
[3297.9s] We had to pull a very five, it was a $400,000 project for over two years.
[3302.9s] two years and we have to multiple sorts of funding.
[3307.9s] This is my list of grants that I feel in the,
[3311.9s] I took a long time to get even access to a database like Candid.
[3315.9s] It was kind of bureaucratically hard, which it shouldn't have been.
[3319.9s] But, you know, it's one of the things I'm discovering about that sort of thing in general.
[3322.9s] It's working with other people and trying to hold...
[3325.9s] You've done a great job for the days together.
[3327.9s] Well, yeah, I haven't even really started to scrape in general.
[3329.9s] Some youth will be very hard for you for you.
[3332.9s] to get?
[3333.9s] Well, that's kind of what I wanted to...
[3334.9s] Which one?
[3335.9s] To talk about.
[3336.9s] Because, yeah, these are the ones...
[3338.9s] That's California Arts Council, yeah.
[3340.9s] Yeah.
[3341.9s] So I have a variety of programs that I'm brainstorming
[3344.9s] in order to, you know, close the gap between where the North Star is
[3348.9s] currently and where it would need to be for a grant like, you know, arts and youth.
[3353.9s] And so that's one of the things that I sort of wanted you guys for, is like,
[3357.9s] what about this?
[3359.9s] Should I actually try to flesh out this program?
[3361.9s] Or is it an...
[3362.9s] obvious now.
[3363.9s] Let's think about it.
[3364.9s] So anything with California Arts Council, they're not remotely interested in
[3370.9s] history for history's sake or arts and youth for arts and youths sake.
[3375.9s] They are primarily interested in the degree to which you are observing what your project is through
[3382.9s] multiple equity lenses.
[3384.9s] So we are the recipients from the California Arts Council at the moment and it funds
[3391.9s] the most underrepresented kids there are in Nevada County in the last remaining
[3398.9s] residential facility that there is, that takes the space of a juvenile pool facility.
[3404.9s] Do you see what I mean? You can see where I'm going with that narrative.
[3407.9s] Yeah.
[3408.9s] Like it's desperate and saving...
[3410.9s] Yes, gotcha.
[3411.9s] Yes.
[3412.9s] It's completely saving the future of, you know, these poor kids.
[3417.9s] So doing games at...
[3420.9s] you're never going to get a grant from California Arts Council if you use just if you, unless you lace it with all this language.
[3429.9s] So impact project, you might have a better chance of, again, maybe it's about providing access to the North Star to people who just wouldn't, would never go to it otherwise.
[3446.5s] I don't know.
[3447.5s] Well, yeah, I've got...
[3449.5s] I feel like it's almost like...
[3451.5s] I don't know.
[3452.5s] He needs to go more towards like preservation, historical, like, you know.
[3459.5s] What about the California Preservation Foundation? Is that on your list?
[3463.5s] I'm sure it is, but this up here just at the top, are the ones that I thought might be good for asking you about.
[3473.5s] And we don't have to go through all of them.
[3475.5s] With the impact project, let me explain what they, because I know the whole history of how they,
[3481.5s] history of how they became that before it was called Local Impact,
[3486.5s] and then there was a project called Artists in Community,
[3492.5s] and then they combined the two and it became...
[3494.5s] In fact projects, which is very hard to get.
[3498.5s] It's one of the hardest grants to get.
[3501.5s] And yet, so here's what they're looking for with that project.
[3505.5s] They're looking for the community dialogue, so you need community engagement.
[3509.5s] That's what No one starts telling.
[3510.5s] North Stars telling you it needs.
[3512.5s] So what Impact Projects aims to do is to bring communities together
[3516.5s] to speak about things that are critically important.
[3521.5s] So you could be looking people to come and...
[3527.5s] It could be part of reparations.
[3529.5s] It could be connected with the land that the North Star is on.
[3533.5s] It's clearly very special than this land, right?
[3537.5s] So you could say that you're going to have...
[3539.5s] that you're going to have a sequence of community conversations that are connected with seeking reparations
[3551.8s] that you could during, you know, you could also, like, pick the, be listing, what I mean?
[3562.0s] Like, it was it a girls' school at one time?
[3573.2s] It was...
[3574.2s] I don't know if it was like a natural girls' school, but it was a school.
[3576.2s] Yeah.
[3577.2s] Yeah.
[3578.2s] Fascinating.
[3579.2s] Like, there's some, you could really go to town.
[3582.2s] Like, I think in a seriously exciting sequence of.
[3585.2s] sequence of dialogues that will bring to light little-known facts
[3592.2s] and that will also share values that are bringing people into the present and
[3600.2s] right.
[3601.2s] And then there Yerba Land Trust who now owns that land.
[3607.2s] And is there like, could there be a project of like trail access that they partner with there
[3614.2s] land trust that could lead them to the gallery.
[3618.7s] It could be a wayfinding project too.
[3620.7s] What are you going to say?
[3621.7s] Yeah.
[3622.7s] One of the things that Hillary told me was that the North Our House was used,
[3630.6s] I don't know if it was over one or one or war two,
[3632.6s] but the government was building family support housing.
[3635.6s] I think that's largely what kind of contributed to its natural significant.
[3639.6s] So the state is deeply interested in housing.
[3642.6s] So it was used as a model for that.
[3645.6s] And the thing is that
[3646.6s] that Julie Morgan only did those designs if they would allow black soldiers families to stay in them.
[3653.6s] Oh my God, that's fascinating.
[3655.6s] So that is another echo line.
[3656.6s] All of that stuff they would love.
[3658.6s] Yeah.
[3659.6s] And that's also California, classic California communities.
[3662.6s] Yes.
[3663.6s] And then again, that wayfinding,
[3667.6s] when you mentioned those trail heads and things,
[3670.6s] wayfinding is a fascinating dimension of community engagement.
[3675.6s] that you could seek funding for.
[3678.6s] Right.
[3679.6s] What do you like anything you know?
[3681.6s] Interpretive signage, you know, and also like trail access.
[3686.6s] Like is there potentially like a, you know, somewhere in there that could,
[3692.6s] that you could partner with very building trust?
[3696.6s] Yeah.
[3697.6s] And imagine you arrive on the property of the North Star Trust and there's a ginormous sort of bit of intent of signage that's,
[3704.6s] that's maybe this size or slightly larger.
[3707.9s] And it shows a bird's eye view of the property margins
[3712.1s] and the different things.
[3714.7s] And then there are dots on it which say,
[3718.1s] this is the Spong, Hugo, whatever it is.
[3726.9s] And this is the Spong where the Nis Man
[3729.4s] round their medicines together.
[3732.1s] Do you know what I mean?
[3733.0s] Yeah.
[3734.0s] Yeah.
[3735.0s] That's what I mean.
[3740.6s] And all of that, those are all at a high level,
[3744.0s] kind of brainstormed already.
[3746.0s] But when it comes to like what to really focus on, it is a little bit more difficult for me
[3752.2s] because I don't, I don't know what really sounds good.
[3754.5s] I don't have any experience in actually sending something out and getting denied.
[3758.5s] There's one big grant they applied for, the ATR grant that they got denied for last year,
[3763.1s] and we're only just now getting the reasons why.
[3765.5s] What is the AETR?
[3770.0s] Yeah, it's, because we're reapplying for it now.
[3775.2s] That's good that you're reapplying if you've got your feedback.
[3777.9s] Yeah.
[3778.8s] I mean, the California Arts Council, feedback is so bad that it's absolutely no use to anyone.
[3785.2s] Whereas in the past it was, I don't know enough to be able to give you.
[3792.8s] I sort of think if you're coming from the right place with what you want.
[3796.8s] Well, here's kind of another thing is, in order to narrow it down for me, is I was going to ask,
[3803.3s] because you've got the whole culture forward plan.
[3805.8s] Yeah.
[3806.8s] Is there any way that you can identify, we would like you for this, we would like you to host this event.
[3813.5s] We would like you to do poetry readings at the Master House, something that would actually allow us to start the clock on arts programming and also legitimately just be helpful in some way.
[3823.8s] Do you have a question for you? What's your internet like now?
[3828.0s] Is it a good connection you mean? Like, yeah, I think it's fairly okay.
[3831.0s] So we had a beautiful event that took place in an old song that was on the face of it, beautiful.
[3838.0s] and for us it was a disaster because the folks that ran it at the time simply didn't understand the level of broadband needed for us to be able to run an effective event.
[3850.0s] And it's prevented us coming back to you.
[3853.0s] I see, okay.
[3854.0s] It's really interesting.
[3855.0s] Well, I think it was partially on the person that was coordinating to not have checked also.
[3862.0s] So I don't, I wouldn't say, it was partially on us too.
[3867.0s] too, like, but it wasn't, it was, we had a person that's not, she, like, moved away.
[3872.0s] She's amazing, Lucy.
[3874.0s] But, you know, I mean, as an event producer, as the experience that I have with production,
[3881.0s] it's like, I would have never gotten to the place and find out there's no internet.
[3886.0s] Like, that is something that is a walk through, like, you have several conversations,
[3891.0s] you run, like, so it was kind of on us, too, you know.
[3895.0s] I would say that could also be something you're applying for, is to ensure that, I don't know what that looks like, but infrastructure is very important at the long-stop.
[3906.0s] Yeah.
[3907.0s] We've had first-hand.
[3908.0s] Like, I would love to come back there again, but I was kind of traumatized by what happened with that in it.
[3914.0s] I mean, I've done what I'm doing now with you there without issue, but that's, to me, with a laptop.
[3920.0s] And how long ago was that?
[3922.0s] Right.
[3923.0s] Three years ago being there.
[3924.0s] Yeah.
[3924.5s] It's possible that it's different.
[3926.0s] But other than that, it really was, the environment was amazing.
[3930.5s] People loved being there.
[3932.5s] Like, yeah.
[3934.5s] And when you think of art, are you thinking, what are you thinking?
[3939.5s] Like, what's your picture of, when you say art, what do you mean in your mind?
[3944.5s] Well, it's kind of hard, really.
[3949.5s] What I would imagine I would want to go to the North Star House for,
[3954.5s] would be something like utilizing the lawn for like a repair cafe where people brought, you know, a lot of broken things and resident artists, you know, like, repaired it, you know, people have certain skills.
[3964.5s] That's great, because it's got that lovely courtyard, that forecourt where you could do that kind of stuff.
[3969.5s] General farmers market type stuff, trails obviously really, really cool.
[3973.5s] Poetry readings or literary readings that are also maybe somewhat catered in, you know, cooperation with Sierra Commons.
[3981.5s] They do the whole like food incubator thing.
[3983.5s] incubator thing.
[3984.5s] There's people who are always trying to do new food startups.
[3986.5s] Maybe that's a way to kind of sync those things up.
[3989.5s] But yeah, just generally, I think the easiest thing right now is to piggyback off of other people's presentations that they need,
[3996.5s] they need space for, you know, and offering that, you know, at an extremely reduced cost or free.
[4002.5s] Yeah.
[4003.5s] But yeah, building...
[4004.5s] So you want to be a host for them, not to produce them?
[4007.5s] I don't think that's necessarily the end game, but just to get blood pumping.
[4012.5s] Sure.
[4013.5s] Yeah, maybe not the worst place to start.
[4015.5s] It's forming relationships.
[4016.5s] Because you don't have staff to, like, for instance, run a program.
[4019.5s] Right?
[4020.5s] I think that there is a pretty large volunteer database that I haven't looked through.
[4025.5s] I haven't gained access to it and being able to really triage it and see,
[4028.5s] like, ooh, there's a lot of people who are really good at this particular thing.
[4031.5s] We could build a whole program around that.
[4033.0s] But I think there are really willing people, according to Haley, so far,
[4036.5s] when they want to do something, it's not hard to get volunteers to go and attend
[4042.5s] in whatever capacity.
[4043.5s] So really, really, you're not looking to produce.
[4047.5s] You're looking to present.
[4049.5s] I think producing would be awesome.
[4051.5s] That was where, that's where I would like to get to.
[4053.5s] It is a lot of work.
[4055.5s] Sure.
[4056.5s] And the work, I, you know, it really, it kind of depends
[4060.5s] on how things go with my proposal for them,
[4063.5s] because I know Haley, the operations manager, is already extremely overwhelmed.
[4067.5s] So adding more programming and actually,
[4069.5s] maintaining all the correspondence that you're getting from everybody,
[4072.5s] everybody and just emails in general.
[4075.5s] That probably fills her time.
[4077.5s] Yeah.
[4078.5s] Yeah.
[4079.5s] So, I mean, I'm definitely interested in doing that,
[4082.0s] but I can't, I can't do that and have a different job
[4085.5s] and raise a kid.
[4087.5s] So if they, you know, want to pay me,
[4089.5s] then yes, I'm absolutely open to picking a couple great programs
[4093.5s] that fill a gap.
[4095.5s] Are there any gaps, you know, that you really wish?
[4098.5s] In the community.
[4099.5s] Yeah.
[4100.5s] Yeah.
[4101.5s] Yeah.
[4102.5s] kind of what I was curious about.
[4104.5s] I think it's so rich here.
[4105.5s] There's something, I mean, it's just a phenomenal place.
[4107.5s] Yeah.
[4108.5s] How long have you been here?
[4109.5s] I've lived here for a really long time,
[4111.5s] but I'm only kind of poking my head out in this capacity
[4113.5s] over the past couple years.
[4115.5s] Having a daughter has really changed things.
[4117.5s] Well, you've been in the area.
[4119.5s] Oh yeah, like 17 years, yeah.
[4121.5s] I went to Deer Creek and then left and came back and I've been back.
[4124.5s] So you participated in things.
[4126.5s] Yeah.
[4127.5s] Yeah.
[4128.5s] Yeah.
[4129.5s] I mean, definitely youth.
[4130.5s] It's a real issue.
[4131.5s] I don't have places.
[4132.5s] to go.
[4133.5s] Kyle, what do you think this message?
[4135.5s] Can you think they make that message?
[4136.5s] You did more of?
[4137.5s] What?
[4138.5s] Yeah.
[4139.5s] Just things that could happen at the North Star.
[4142.5s] Oh, just kind of in the North Star.
[4144.5s] Yeah, I mean, I know that it's like, you hear kids saying,
[4147.5s] oh, they don't have stuff to do.
[4149.5s] Right.
[4150.5s] I don't know what that is.
[4152.5s] Yeah.
[4153.5s] I didn't know when I was their age either.
[4155.5s] Mm.
[4156.5s] And, but I know that there's, like, things for teens, especially,
[4163.6s] But also, I think there's a lot of potential out there for stuff that is lower cost,
[4171.6s] things like music or theater or stand-up comedy or whatever.
[4176.6s] Mm-hmm.
[4177.6s] Or maybe a years ago when I worked for a theater company that was making
[4181.6s] the student's away, so the student change was fully left.
[4184.6s] Oh, that's right.
[4185.6s] So, okay, we're going to go into movies.
[4187.6s] Oh, is there any?
[4189.6s] Open mics are incredibly popular with you.
[4191.6s] Yeah.
[4192.6s] And in general, it does an opportunity.
[4193.6s] up search of anything connected with any kind of open mic.
[4197.6s] So, and that's something for sure, like, so say, for example,
[4201.6s] you chose to do an open night during National Poetry Month, which is,
[4207.6s] or you could do it on World Poetry Day, which is March 21st,
[4211.6s] we could then celebrate that under the umbrella of Sierra Poetry Festival
[4217.6s] and help get the word out.
[4219.6s] And open mics are so easy to organize.
[4222.6s] to organize.
[4223.6s] They're so easy.
[4224.6s] Yeah.
[4225.6s] And it just brings a flood of people in.
[4227.6s] And then maybe you have like a NOVA's farther going on where people can just get.
[4232.6s] Are you licensed?
[4233.6s] Yeah.
[4234.6s] I have no idea.
[4235.6s] I don't think so.
[4236.6s] Yeah.
[4237.6s] I don't think enough.
[4238.6s] So.
[4239.6s] It depends what you want.
[4240.6s] You could bring a license.
[4241.6s] Yes, sure.
[4243.6s] Or you could apply to ABC for temporary license.
[4247.6s] Exactly.
[4248.6s] But anyway, open lights tend to be, I'm struggling to think,
[4251.6s] struggling to think of, they're just so popular open nights, aren't they?
[4256.6s] And they're so easy.
[4257.6s] They take almost no organization.
[4260.6s] Potentially, speaking to the library could be an idea.
[4265.6s] What's that?
[4266.6s] Speaking to the library could be a potential idea,
[4269.6s] because I know they have a lot of programming with youth around.
[4273.6s] And they might also want to come out and do something like...
[4277.6s] Well, yeah.
[4278.6s] Yeah.
[4279.6s] Yeah.
[4280.6s] Yeah.
[4281.6s] We could connect to the librarians.
[4284.6s] Yeah.
[4285.6s] Okay.
[4286.6s] And there's also a junior.
[4287.6s] The handball is the adult, and then there's a youth.
[4292.6s] There's a person.
[4294.6s] Yeah.
[4295.6s] But they walk very closely together.
[4297.6s] And they'll do like rock shows, punk shows at the library.
[4302.6s] Oh, yeah.
[4303.6s] I saw a flyer for that one.
[4304.6s] Yeah.
[4305.6s] So maybe there's like a punk show.
[4307.6s] You know, I know the cultural district.
[4310.6s] We got grants for.
[4311.6s] like this one group of like really young kids that are like,
[4317.6s] they have a full on production.
[4319.6s] They didn't get selected.
[4320.6s] Oh.
[4321.6s] It's heartbreaking.
[4322.6s] They're called Earthtones.
[4324.6s] And they...
[4325.6s] That's a heartbreaking.
[4326.6s] Yeah.
[4327.6s] They're full on production.
[4330.6s] Like, they have producers.
[4333.6s] They have sound kids.
[4336.6s] They have like all the tech kids.
[4339.6s] They have the guitarists.
[4340.6s] The guitarists.
[4341.6s] vocalists, they have bands, like, and they go out and play festivals.
[4346.6s] And they, like, they could, all of them could come together and put up a festival.
[4351.6s] And they applied to the mini grant to do this Earth Tones festival.
[4356.6s] That could actually, I have a project that they applied to.
[4361.6s] Like...
[4362.6s] So we could give that application to you and then...
[4365.6s] Yeah.
[4366.6s] Because that could be something you could apply and you can really engage with Ben
[4370.6s] because they...
[4371.6s] They're out here, like they know people.
[4374.6s] They want to do a festival.
[4376.6s] And they apply to do it at the park.
[4378.6s] There's another thing, yeah.
[4380.6s] Okay.
[4381.6s] That's good.
[4382.6s] Yeah.
[4383.6s] Between moving, which I've never seen here,
[4403.8s] and it was, I can't remember the name of it,
[4406.8s] but it was like a day in which anyone
[4410.8s] that had a special ability or a disability,
[4414.8s] young, usually young people, but it could be older people too,
[4417.8s] could just come and be.
[4418.8s] make art, all different things.
[4420.8s] And it was just so popular and so heavenly.
[4423.8s] It was just so lovely.
[4424.8s] Everyone loved it.
[4425.8s] Everyone wanted to support it.
[4427.8s] All the local businesses wanted to sponsor it.
[4432.2s] Yeah.
[4433.2s] So that's very specific because that's adults with special abilities,
[4438.2s] which, you know, intellectual, developmental issues.
[4443.2s] So, but this was more broad.
[4446.2s] It was just anyone with a disability of any kind.
[4449.2s] of any kind, you know what I mean?
[4451.2s] And it was phenomenally,
[4453.2s] regionally popular.
[4454.2s] Everyone loved it happen once a year.
[4456.2s] I've never seen it happen here.
[4458.2s] Okay.
[4459.2s] This is not.
[4460.2s] That is really interesting.
[4462.2s] Yeah, it's really, really popular.
[4464.2s] Like, and it could be like,
[4466.2s] you could also, like, launch an exhibition
[4469.2s] and hosted in your gallery, the forehand,
[4474.4s] of their art is so touching.
[4476.4s] Yeah.
[4477.4s] So sweet.
[4478.4s] Okay.
[4479.4s] So, yeah.
[4480.4s] So, yeah.
[4481.4s] Deadbeat and Company?
[4486.9s] Yeah, I think so.
[4487.9s] Yeah.
[4488.9s] That's what it was in Muse.
[4489.9s] Like, I grabbed everything from Muse.
[4491.9s] That's their name.
[4493.9s] Actually, they changed their name.
[4496.9s] Okay.
[4497.9s] Even though a month ago they said Deadbeat.
[4499.9s] They told me, he's like, we changed the name.
[4502.9s] Okay, well, I have them here as Deadbeats and Company.
[4505.9s] Yeah, but it's them, it's the same group they just changed.
[4509.9s] Yeah.
[4510.9s] So the North Star House would be a great location for that.
[4513.9s] Probably not until the second floor is really done,
[4515.9s] because it's kind of small otherwise.
[4517.9s] Well, it doesn't have to be a large, Mr. Oh, okay.
[4519.9s] Cool.
[4520.9s] But it's like that a dinner thing?
[4522.9s] Well, so it depends.
[4523.9s] They're not all different things.
[4525.9s] They just call them.
[4526.9s] Yeah.
[4527.9s] Do you know what I mean?
[4528.9s] Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[4529.9s] It sounds so techy, but the most be weird.
[4531.9s] I think it's great.
[4533.9s] Yeah.
[4534.9s] Yeah.
[4535.9s] Yeah.
[4541.3s] Yeah.
[4542.3s] Yeah.
[4543.3s] Yeah, that's, I thought about that there.
[4544.3s] And that's the one that got really excited.
[4546.8s] Like, I would attend that personally.
[4548.3s] That sounds really, really cool.
[4550.3s] They're actually happening this weekend and next weekend.
[4555.3s] They're going on.
[4556.3s] The events are happening.
[4557.3s] I could potentially go and approach someone or participate
[4560.3s] and see if it would work.
[4564.3s] Okay, cool.
[4565.3s] Yeah, I know their performance is at.
[4567.3s] Yeah, like Jen, wait, what is the,
[4571.3s] they're on our events.
[4573.3s] I see.
[4574.3s] I saw them rehearsing last night at the National, and it kicks off today.
[4579.3s] Let's see.
[4581.3s] I have a list of questions that I was going to just ask.
[4586.3s] Mm-hmm.
[4587.3s] Please do.
[4588.3s] And they won't have to go quite a seat.
[4590.3s] Yeah, I don't want to waste too much of your time.
[4592.3s] No, no, you're not wasting any time.
[4598.3s] Oh, okay.
[4599.3s] The name is Killer Connection, a dating game show live on air.
[4603.3s] Oh, my God.
[4604.3s] What about speed dating?
[4605.3s] February 5th and the next weekend.
[4607.3s] Is speed dating?
[4608.3s] Do they do that there?
[4611.3s] No, this is a different.
[4612.3s] Oh.
[4613.3s] I don't know what this is.
[4614.3s] A dating game show.
[4615.3s] I think it's a...
[4618.3s] Sorry, I'm just coming up with a...
[4622.4s] That's funny.
[4623.4s] It's hilarious.
[4624.4s] You know Robin?
[4625.4s] Our board member, but she would love this.
[4628.4s] So Robin is early 60s, and she just wants to date.
[4633.4s] And there are all these baby boomers here,
[4637.4s] like women and men, and they just want to date people.
[4639.4s] just want to date people and they're not having any love at all.
[4642.4s] Can't you do some hilarious feedbacking for the North Star?
[4645.9s] Why not?
[4646.9s] Yeah, there's a lot of open calendar space.
[4649.9s] You do have to put an age group though,
[4653.4s] because you don't have to call it something.
[4655.4s] And we do also, we do want to make the programming
[4660.4s] in the events somehow strengthen something that, you know,
[4664.4s] brings money in eventually, you know,
[4665.9s] does it strengthen us with a grant?
[4667.4s] I mean, relationship building is fantastic.
[4669.4s] But I'm sure there's plenty of people that would like to just use the space,
[4672.1s] but we have to be somewhat discriminating on like,
[4674.4s] what are we building as a result of this?
[4677.4s] I think it would be fantastic.
[4678.9s] And maybe if it results in a news article, that's a win.
[4682.4s] Well, also, like, many of these lonely, slightly older people,
[4686.4s] but people who don't consider themselves to be already yet,
[4689.9s] they also have, they're the ones with the expendable income.
[4693.4s] So you could capitalize on that over time.
[4695.4s] Yeah.
[4696.4s] It's, I will definitely brainstorm a program.
[4699.4s] on that.
[4700.4s] You're getting some really kind of weird left-fills ideas.
[4702.4s] Oh, yeah, that's great.
[4703.4s] Yeah, that's great.
[4704.4s] Well...
[4705.4s] I just have to tell you very quickly it's a little more but interesting.
[4709.4s] When I worked at Princess Foods Lines, they did murder mystery dinners on the cruises.
[4715.4s] And in Alaska, I remember I wrote the copy for a bunch of this, you know, whatever.
[4721.4s] Mm-hmm.
[4722.4s] And a man actually killed his wife during the murder mystery.
[4725.4s] Oh, my God.
[4727.4s] And I was like,
[4728.4s] that is a lot.
[4729.4s] a TV, like, that's a Colombo.
[4731.4s] Oh, my God.
[4732.4s] Commitment.
[4733.4s] You don't get that kind of, like, improv.
[4735.4s] I know.
[4736.4s] He was committed.
[4738.4s] I'm sorry.
[4740.4s] That's just horrific.
[4741.4s] It was wild.
[4742.4s] Jesus.
[4743.4s] I remember them just...
[4744.4s] What did he do it?
[4746.4s] Oh, my God.
[4748.4s] That's a bold.
[4750.4s] They were like, don't talk about it.
[4751.4s] I was like, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[4753.4s] And then they were like,
[4754.4s] did you know.
[4755.4s] Sorry, that just came back to me, and I had to say,
[4757.4s] I know it's more good.
[4758.4s] You had to say.
[4759.4s] say to get it off their chest, but not,
[4761.4s] and not they're not.
[4763.4s] Now it's...
[4764.4s] Okay, so you have some questions for us.
[4767.4s] Right, yeah, and we've probably covered
[4769.4s] a decent majority.
[4770.4s] These were just my talking points.
[4771.4s] I do like the idea of the neighborhood center
[4774.4s] for the arts.
[4775.4s] Yeah, I'm going to say if I can't
[4777.4s] be partnering with them,
[4779.4s] like, because then you could apply
[4781.4s] and have them be, like,
[4784.4s] the partner and the grant.
[4786.4s] Yeah.
[4787.4s] Because they are doing incredible work.
[4789.4s] So it might be good to, like,
[4791.4s] potentially get a meeting with them
[4792.4s] and see if they would have any countries.
[4794.4s] That could be an impact project.
[4796.4s] You think, with neighborhood center of yards?
[4804.1s] Yeah, and serving and, like,
[4815.9s] targeting, like, underserved community,
[4817.9s] which, with neighborhoods and disabilities,
[4824.3s] that could be a really good one.
[4826.3s] Yeah, it sounds, yeah, but that's definitely one.
[4830.3s] What, like, if, Eliza,
[4832.3s] if we were to take the Earth's home project that I was talking,
[4834.3s] that I was talking about with the youth.
[4837.3s] They applied to the mini-grant.
[4840.3s] Oh, here it's cool.
[4841.3s] Look, I've just found it.
[4842.3s] Sorry.
[4843.3s] It's called the very special arts festival.
[4845.3s] It's the cutest thing.
[4846.3s] Isn't that just a lovely name?
[4848.3s] Yeah.
[4849.3s] Yeah.
[4850.3s] Very special arts of California is a highly recognized,
[4856.0s] affiliated with it, well, I never knew that,
[4858.0s] with the John and Kennedy Center.
[4860.0s] Well, we are proud to be affiliates
[4862.0s] and providers of this arts education program
[4865.0s] of those special needs students,
[4867.0s] either such an area.
[4871.6s] That could be a really interesting.
[4872.6s] So there's a whole lot on the website
[4874.6s] on it, you can just model it after that.
[4877.6s] It's seriously, seriously,
[4879.6s] everyone always wants to sponsor all.
[4881.6s] Yeah, yeah.
[4882.6s] And that could be a partnership with neighborhood, right?
[4885.6s] That's what you're thinking.
[4886.6s] Yes, I mean, neighborhood is one,
[4888.6s] but you can get much bigger with that.
[4890.6s] I mean, neighborhood is,
[4892.6s] the center of the arts,
[4894.6s] is putting a very niche,
[4897.6s] niche service, a beautiful service to a minute part of the special needs population.
[4906.6s] So it's only very, it's only serving a very small, very niche,
[4910.6s] but we have so little for here.
[4913.6s] It's just a very undernourished section of the community.
[4917.6s] Yeah.
[4918.6s] Very special arts, it's called.
[4920.6s] So, like, if he wanted to develop a project with Earth Helms,
[4924.6s] which is the student that I've been talking about, like, what,
[4927.6s] what do you think could be the branch that you could apply for?
[4931.6s] You know?
[4932.6s] Like, would it be called point of humanities?
[4934.6s] Would it be a pet project?
[4936.6s] So, I can do it in reverse, too.
[4937.6s] I can brainstorm and then run that program
[4942.6s] brief through the internet and through my databases
[4945.6s] and say, like, what does this match up with?
[4947.6s] You don't have to know off the top of your head.
[4948.6s] If you do know, great.
[4950.6s] Yeah.
[4951.6s] I would only say that one thing that probably wouldn't
[4956.6s] work is if California Arts Council wants you to create something new.
[4963.6s] Do you know what I mean?
[4964.6s] Yeah.
[4965.6s] And so it doesn't want you to tell it that with the grant money,
[4968.6s] you're going to rent this service from this existing people
[4972.6s] for the Earth Turns.
[4973.6s] Yeah.
[4974.6s] But it would be interested in what Earth Turns does.
[4978.6s] Do you see what I mean, the difference?
[4982.6s] But if a festival was created around it that didn't previously exist,
[4985.6s] that would be a festival.
[4986.6s] Yeah, that's what they want to do, like a festival.
[4991.6s] Yes, they're not, I mean, I have to say, California Arts Council isn't that into festivals.
[4997.6s] Admittedly, it was the thing that seed funded Sierra Cultural Festival for us,
[5001.6s] but never again, they quickly moved into social practice arts,
[5005.6s] and they really are into social practice arts.
[5009.6s] You might look a little bit, if you are interested in funding from California Arts Council,
[5014.6s] you might explore what social
[5016.6s] practice of arts looks like for the old start.
[5021.6s] Do you know what I mean?
[5022.6s] Oh my God, the PG&E Foundation.
[5025.6s] We need to.
[5026.6s] Yeah.
[5027.6s] We have all these names and culture forward.
[5029.6s] We need to, for a fair amount of background.
[5032.6s] Yeah.
[5033.6s] Yeah.
[5034.6s] Cloud code is great for that.
[5035.6s] If you use me with perplexity too.
[5037.6s] I mean, if you wanted to build a gigantic database like this,
[5040.6s] I did this as a result.
[5042.6s] I didn't have to do the TDM coding.
[5044.6s] I didn't have to go in manually.
[5045.6s] How do it?
[5046.6s] to build this list.
[5048.6s] Oh, yes.
[5050.6s] Have a good weekend.
[5052.6s] Should we be in touch by text?
[5054.6s] Okay, sweet.
[5056.6s] Yeah, you too.
[5058.6s] Bye.
[5059.6s] Have a lovely weekend, will you?
[5060.6s] All right.
[5061.6s] Take my phone.
[5062.6s] Populating the database with information
[5066.6s] does not take a lot of time, but as I'm using it
[5069.6s] and adding more information and, you know, it grows into
[5072.6s] now we have a donor's database and a program's database
[5074.6s] and database of documents and contacts.
[5075.6s] documents and contacts.
[5077.6s] What the schema should be changes and requires,
[5081.6s] AI just can't decide that for me.
[5083.6s] As I'm using it, it's like I don't really like the way this works.
[5085.6s] So it takes multiple days, but
[5088.6s] I don't have to actually go in there and click on anything.
[5091.6s] I just use natural language to say,
[5093.6s] I don't like this about the database.
[5095.6s] Can you suggest something?
[5096.6s] Can you show me what it would look like afterwards without actually
[5099.6s] changing it?
[5100.6s] Okay, I approve.
[5102.6s] What about you personally?
[5104.6s] What if you?
[5105.6s] What's the outcome of working with the male staff for you?
[5108.6s] Is it a job at the end of that?
[5110.6s] It's experience, its connection, it's actually trying to do something
[5115.6s] that good in the world that actually does have an impact.
[5118.6s] I do not want to just be sitting at my computer
[5121.6s] creating digital assets for digital consumption.
[5125.6s] I want to actually network and build something.
[5128.6s] What did you do before?
[5130.6s] I've been at the mine shaft before this and less meaningful.
[5134.6s] The last meaningful job that I had that I was, you know, behind the mission statement at least, was Breyer Patch.
[5140.6s] And I was the, in charge of the kitchen warehouse aspect of things.
[5145.6s] Gotcha.
[5146.6s] Okay.
[5147.6s] But yeah.
[5148.6s] Gosh, so this is a different, really interesting.
[5150.6s] This is brand, it's brand new, yeah.
[5152.6s] And how long have you been there?
[5154.6s] Oh, just since December.
[5156.6s] Okay, so nothing at all.
[5157.6s] No.
[5158.6s] And you already applied programs?
[5161.6s] Yeah, yeah.
[5162.6s] And a couple other letters of interest are out there.
[5163.6s] And, yeah.
[5164.6s] Yeah.
[5165.6s] I feel that we should have a self-issue with Niagara County Arts Council in our time.
[5173.6s] I mean, we have this very bizarre job.
[5177.6s] Like, and we are one of the top-ranking arts councils in California.
[5181.6s] We're weird because we do, we work in a very sort of urbane way, despite being the very rural.
[5188.6s] We have great people working for us, with us, and we're a very, very small team.
[5193.6s] And we have,
[5194.6s] this genuinely altruistic mission of just like complete service to our artist community and our community at large.
[5206.6s] But our mentor is so heavy and where we've just been told we were hoping that the governor would propose
[5214.6s] continued funding for the California Cultural District program, which is what funds us to do news and paste G.
[5223.6s] and Hannah and part of me and gives us this office and the office up in Turkey that we also have.
[5231.6s] And there isn't any funding. So we're now in a moment of austerity here, where it was a fantastic moment where we've just got the county to approve a brand new board objective that's never existed before, which is arts and culture, which is a huge deal, because it opens the door from our dialogue.
[5250.6s] And we have culture forward.
[5251.6s] with the first ever six-year asking what your action flag.
[5255.6s] So it's like this phenomenal, phenomenal electric moment for which,
[5260.6s] that we've got this like potentially dark horizon as well.
[5264.6s] So I'm thinking, you are just seriously brilliant guy.
[5268.6s] Like, how, what can we do quickly with Kaylan?
[5272.6s] And it would be great for Hannah to me.
[5276.6s] Because Cameron and I, when we met yesterday, we were talking about all the work that she was
[5281.6s] wants to do in their table and all the automatic automations she needs to do and the Google
[5287.6s] works based up and if she even knew half of what could be achieved through this, it might be incredible.
[5294.6s] Yeah, that was the whole idea is, you know, being able to do more with less.
[5299.6s] I was aware that funding was getting cut all over the place.
[5302.6s] I was, you know, last year was really stressful.
[5305.6s] Just being a part of the news cycle.
[5307.6s] You've found Nevada County Arts Council before because
[5310.6s] because our role is to somehow serve the entire ecosystem, arts ecosystem.
[5319.6s] Well, that's what I would like to do too.
[5321.6s] I'm not beholden to the North Star House in particular.
[5324.6s] I feel like I could help the North Star House wherever it is that I am.
[5327.6s] And I could help, you know, maybe you guys too,
[5330.6s] which is kind of part of one of the questions, you know, that I was going to ask,
[5334.6s] is that's where I am now.
[5337.6s] But I want the North Star House to be part,
[5339.6s] to be part of the ecosystem, integrated as a whole, and actually utilized by you.
[5346.6s] And yeah, so the questions of like, this was just something that I sent off to the document that I sent
[5354.1s] to Haley to see if she wanted to ask, add anything.
[5356.1s] But yeah, how can we be more active in the cultural district?
[5358.6s] Yeah.
[5359.6s] So one of the things that we...
[5360.6s] Is that from Haley?
[5362.1s] I sent this to Haley.
[5363.6s] She didn't, yeah, write anything about.
[5364.6s] One of the things that we would love to do is to...
[5368.6s] Deep now website.
[5370.6s] Just to send us that.
[5371.6s] Because look, Arts Council Office,
[5373.6s] do you still want me to float the idea of housing their office
[5377.6s] in North Star House?
[5379.6s] That would be...
[5380.6s] Yeah, Haley wanted to extend that offer, but if the Internet's trash.
[5383.6s] Right.
[5384.6s] You know, and that's all the second floor depending.
[5386.6s] Yeah.
[5387.6s] What an amazing thing.
[5388.6s] Let me just run through a couple of things.
[5390.6s] Sure.
[5391.6s] Yeah.
[5392.6s] First thing you can do is ensure that there is language on your website that
[5397.6s] website that claims cried and, you know, you're proud part of a state California cultural district.
[5406.1s] So you can say, on the front of Muse, you see this logo, it's a badge that says California...
[5412.6s] Yeah.
[5413.6s] That's the state badge for the California Cultural District Program.
[5417.6s] Could we, could I just throw one of those up on that?
[5420.6s] Absolutely.
[5421.6s] The image line.
[5422.6s] And then the...
[5423.6s] Should be the GV&C, though.
[5425.6s] Yes.
[5426.6s] Yes.
[5427.6s] So I'll send you the logo and like an acknowledgement that you can give just to like, yeah.
[5433.6s] Like an MOU type thing?
[5435.6s] Well, it's just like this, we are in, we have like an acknowledgement that we give.
[5440.6s] It's like a little toolkit for you.
[5442.6s] Yeah.
[5443.6s] Like this is how to use this language.
[5444.6s] Just to say we're a designated cultural district and we are within the boundaries of the grass valley.
[5449.6s] Cool.
[5452.2s] Yeah.
[5453.2s] We intentionally, when we set the boundary intentionally, you know, it was very special place.
[5464.0s] Even though it's been kind of reclusive as far as far as.
[5465.0s] reclusive as far as right now.
[5467.0s] Yeah, you definitely have a beautiful, meaningful space.
[5472.6s] So come to our meetups, you know about those, don't you?
[5476.6s] So we're going to have one next week at K-B-A-M-R.
[5479.6s] Okay.
[5480.6s] That's a place of connection for you personally anyway.
[5484.6s] It's a how, your little one is two, did you say?
[5487.6s] Mm-hmm.
[5488.6s] Are you a sole dad?
[5489.6s] A solo dad?
[5490.6s] A solo dad.
[5491.6s] Yeah.
[5492.6s] Yeah.
[5493.6s] Bring her.
[5494.6s] Okay.
[5495.6s] Her, yeah.
[5496.6s] I bring her.
[5497.6s] It's totally fine.
[5498.6s] I think she's too young.
[5499.6s] No.
[5500.6s] A lot of people.
[5501.6s] I mean, yeah.
[5502.6s] I can have Regina, her mom on standby if it doesn't really don't.
[5506.6s] Everything is more enjoyable for me when she's around, so.
[5510.6s] Yeah, so do that.
[5511.6s] That's fine.
[5512.6s] Like people bring dogs, why not kids?
[5513.6s] I'm a mother of three.
[5514.6s] They're all grown up.
[5515.6s] That's true, yeah.
[5516.6s] We shouldn't go because I don't see a lot of kids.
[5518.6s] Especially in Nevada City and like we're all,
[5521.6s] in such kind of wonderful, hilarious hippie community.
[5524.6s] There's all kinds of situations going on.
[5525.6s] Oh, yeah.
[5526.6s] I know.
[5527.6s] It's like a Star Wars canteen.
[5528.6s] So we need to be welcoming.
[5529.6s] My sister is married to someone who's friends with your son, I think, Fabian.
[5534.6s] Oh, yeah?
[5535.6s] Yeah, Sony Servantes.
[5537.6s] I mentioned that I was having a meeting Sonia Servantes.
[5540.6s] I don't know if you know.
[5541.6s] Do you know what's Sonia's relationship to Fabian?
[5545.6s] I guess they're friends.
[5547.6s] I don't know.
[5548.6s] I mentioned that I had a meeting at the Arts Council.
[5550.6s] She's like, oh, yeah, one of my friends' moms is like,
[5552.6s] like, oh, Eliza?
[5553.6s] Yeah, Fabian.
[5555.6s] So.
[5556.6s] That's lovely.
[5558.6s] But yeah.
[5559.6s] Yeah, so it's a, we know there's so much more to do at Nevada County Arts Council.
[5567.6s] We're just actually doing a sort of brand alignment thing at the moment
[5571.6s] where we're just taking someone on an artist who is also a creative director
[5577.6s] to help us create a nested identity because we have
[5585.6s] We have Nevada County Arts Guards.
[5587.6s] We have all two California cultures districts.
[5589.6s] Then we have cultural board, which has its own identity,
[5593.6s] and then we have, we have so much here.
[5596.6s] Yeah.
[5597.6s] So we're going through a little bit of a thing.
[5599.6s] So our website will look very different in a couple of months in there.
[5606.9s] So it's a journey about how to get more involved to the public district.
[5610.9s] Yeah, I wasn't expecting there to be, like, here's a one sentence answer.
[5613.9s] Right.
[5614.9s] So come, but keep coming to those creative media.
[5615.9s] Yeah.
[5616.9s] because anything it's happening, we announce then.
[5619.9s] We also give you an opportunity when you arrive at those things.
[5622.9s] You can put your name down if you yourself want to tell the group about,
[5627.9s] say you have a need, just say, I'm...
[5630.9s] Looking for space.
[5632.9s] Yeah.
[5633.9s] Or I'm looking for things that you might want to present at the North Star.
[5637.9s] It's a really cool moment in the North Star.
[5639.9s] Looking for teaching artists.
[5641.9s] Like, yeah, we're looking for your ideas.
[5643.9s] Like, come and talk to me.
[5645.9s] So bring...
[5646.9s] I don't think you make cards or anything.
[5648.9s] But we can also introduce you to people.
[5651.9s] Yeah.
[5652.9s] So that's great.
[5653.9s] That's a monthly thing.
[5654.9s] You know it's going to be there.
[5655.9s] Yeah.
[5659.3s] If you'd ever want to use North Starz, then you know.
[5661.3s] Yes.
[5662.3s] Spring to Art.
[5663.3s] So you've definitely been scraping.
[5665.3s] Spring into art was a program that we developed
[5669.3s] that was then, like we were literally about to launch it.
[5672.3s] We did this with Jesse.
[5674.3s] And then along came COVID.
[5676.3s] So it's on our website.
[5677.3s] Okay.
[5678.3s] but it's invisible, but it's enabled.
[5681.3s] Anyway, no.
[5682.3s] Okay, so I wouldn't have been able to see it,
[5684.3s] but it got surfaced through perplexity.
[5686.3s] That's exactly what I thought.
[5688.3s] Well, we do have in the Cultural District pages
[5691.3s] this way for art, I'm really sure.
[5694.3s] I've seen it on the website.
[5697.3s] It's very old.
[5698.3s] If I had seen it, I would have made sure it wasn't visible,
[5701.3s] but I'd intentionally kept it enabled,
[5704.3s] because occasionally I share it with people as examples.
[5707.3s] even those examples.
[5708.3s] Well, in terms of scraping, I didn't actually scrape anything.
[5712.3s] So it must have come up in perplexity, which is just, you know, a search engine in general.
[5718.3s] Out there somewhere.
[5719.3s] Yeah, so it's out there somewhere.
[5720.3s] Sure.
[5721.3s] Okay, so it's not the thing.
[5723.3s] How's your readings?
[5725.3s] Yeah, in the parlor, it came up with something saying that you were having a hard time finding
[5730.3s] consistent places to host literary events.
[5733.3s] Yeah, see, it is on the cultural district.
[5736.3s] school district.
[5737.3s] Oh, that's bringing to art.
[5739.3s] Yeah.
[5740.3s] That one.
[5741.3s] Yes.
[5742.3s] Oh, how interesting.
[5743.3s] Okay.
[5744.3s] Cool.
[5745.3s] Poetry readings.
[5746.3s] So I can share with you something.
[5749.3s] I'll just do it right now.
[5751.3s] Okay.
[5752.3s] What's your email address?
[5753.3s] Development at the Northstarhouse.
[5755.3s] .
[5756.3s] would be a good one.
[5770.0s] Yes, yeah, French.
[5771.0s] Okay, so I'm just looking at the poetry thing.
[5777.0s] I have a very basic planning document.
[5783.4s] This basic planning document looks like this.
[5797.0s] It basically starts in February, it goes all the way through to April.
[5805.0s] And this is where anyone in the community can add an event that they want to do that's part
[5812.0s] that is poetry-oriented.
[5814.0s] So if you wanted to add an open mic on a day that's a day that's a day that's a
[5816.0s] on a day that's free, just do it and we'll put it on the website and be in touch with you.
[5822.0s] Okay.
[5823.0s] And then people would reach directly out to me?
[5829.3s] I could put my email address?
[5830.3s] Yes.
[5831.3s] We have nothing to be organizing it.
[5832.3s] Good.
[5833.3s] We will, we'd probably create a Facebook event for it and brand it with SPF fringe,
[5838.3s] which is the fringe pop-up festivals that surrounds the main stage 20 April.
[5845.3s] Okay.
[5846.3s] Maybe going to pair with a poet, right?
[5847.3s] it, right?
[5848.3s] For it or whatever?
[5849.3s] Yes, you would be in charge.
[5851.3s] You would, like, you would, um, oh,
[5855.3s] okay, that would stop back your...
[5857.3s] Who is the poet where it right now?
[5859.3s] Cat Terry.
[5860.3s] Okay, right, yeah.
[5861.3s] She's in the truckie.
[5863.3s] Okay.
[5864.3s] Um.
[5865.3s] She would probably like to come down and do something.
[5867.3s] Yeah, I can reach out and just introduce.
[5868.3s] Yeah.
[5869.3s] Yeah.
[5870.3s] Yeah.
[5871.3s] So, maybe...
[5873.3s] Maybe Dino could be a cool.
[5876.3s] Yeah.
[5877.3s] Do you know Parks?
[5879.3s] He was at Sierra College and he would love to the hill.
[5882.3s] Yeah, he might want to, he might want to organize something for St Portrait Festival French.
[5889.3s] And he's young, he's like a youth.
[5891.3s] He just graduated high school, and maybe he's interested in language.
[5896.3s] If you say, look, we have this space, we can offer some sort of support.
[5900.3s] Yeah, it's kind of blank slate if you want to co-develop a program, maybe.
[5904.3s] Yeah.
[5905.3s] I have no idea for you.
[5906.3s] something that isn't done much, but we know that artists love it.
[5911.3s] It's plein air art.
[5913.3s] So it's why you get a bunch of artists,
[5916.3s] you invite a bunch of artists for the visual artists,
[5919.3s] up to the North Star, and they can go anywhere on the property
[5923.3s] and just set up and be painting in nature.
[5926.3s] Yeah, that's one of the programs that I've brainstormed,
[5929.3s] but yeah, I was going to ask you about that, if that would.
[5932.3s] Yeah, it's definitely...
[5933.3s] It definitely has a...
[5934.3s] It definitely has its own...
[5935.3s] It definitely has its own following thing.
[5937.3s] It's so funny because the city of Grass Valley keeps wanting us to do that.
[5942.3s] But we just, we're not really, yes, we have a few programs that we do that
[5948.3s] resemble normal arts things like Sierra Petra Festival,
[5951.3s] but that's because we do, we only do gap programming.
[5956.3s] That means we, if there's a serious need or a lack of something, then we'll do it.
[5962.3s] But increasingly our work is more sort of...
[5964.3s] Yeah.
[5965.3s] connected with marketing, communications.
[5968.3s] Yeah, more strategic, high level.
[5971.3s] Like, I think the more, and like, resources, you know.
[5975.3s] Yes.
[5976.3s] Yeah.
[5977.3s] You're not doing the granular stuff.
[5978.3s] It's like, it takes, like, the event, production takes a lot.
[5983.3s] I get that.
[5984.3s] But we know that the thing is, with him,
[5989.2s] Egypt will do everything on the military, doesn't he?
[5993.9s] They do, like, the North Star House.
[5995.9s] So anything, obviously, we host three different
[6004.4s] obviously you do, but you can find visual artists.
[6014.6s] We can do a call for art, artists, playing, and support you in that way.
[6018.2s] Okay, yeah.
[6019.2s] Cool.
[6020.2s] So that was that, so I didn't have ideas in terms of field trips.
[6025.9s] So, Eliza, what if we got Kaylin to, like, look into the funding plan
[6032.9s] and create a database like he created for the North Star House
[6037.9s] with the funding plan for culture forward?
[6040.9s] Mm-hmm.
[6041.9s] What if we got Kaylin to create a database?
[6043.9s] to create a database like he did for the North Star House based on the funding from the culture forward?
[6049.9s] We have that because our consultants created that for us, but I don't think that they have done the death.
[6056.9s] Right.
[6057.9s] That's what I mean.
[6059.9s] Yeah.
[6060.9s] Well, one thing that I'd be absolutely willing to offer and I was, you know, brainstorming what am I going to do with these skills career-wise,
[6068.9s] being some sort of consultant to come in and actually teach you how to
[6073.9s] use the tools that you would then use to make the database yourself.
[6077.9s] I'm, you know, you and I probably will one-on-one do some Claude Code stuff,
[6083.9s] and you can always reach out when you have questions.
[6085.9s] Yeah.
[6086.9s] And any time new models come out, if there's a new way of doing things, I can be in touch.
[6090.9s] But...
[6091.9s] I mean, I love with Hannah yesterday about next step, you know,
[6099.4s] because I want to extract from her job membership.
[6103.4s] I mean, she, in order for her to,
[6105.4s] grow into a new level within the Arts Council, she's going to have to drop something.
[6110.4s] I just don't know how to do that with all the work that needs to happen.
[6115.4s] That's something that's really wonderful about the abilities under, you know, with Claude Code,
[6120.4s] is as your job expands and you're taking on more and more responsibilities,
[6124.4s] if you need to drop something, you can actually very, very easily write an agent.
[6130.4s] And if you can train an employee to do it, you can train an agent to do it and just say,
[6135.4s] go, do this, it has a whole list of things.
[6138.4s] I think she could really benefit.
[6141.4s] Yeah.
[6142.4s] And that, Claudecode does not replace those people at all.
[6146.4s] It only gives them more tools and allows them to just explode with what they're able to do.
[6151.4s] I think there's been a lot of fear about Claude code, like, no, it doesn't really do that.
[6155.4s] What you showed me about the culturalized amount, I'm very interested.
[6159.4s] Just how quick that was?
[6161.4s] Yeah, it's probably done with the photos too.
[6163.4s] Yeah.
[6164.4s] And also,
[6165.4s] And like, we have to be mindful because, like, there's lots of sentiment around AI, like, we hurt, you know?
[6174.0s] It's very sensitive.
[6175.6s] And I actually really respect Kyle.
[6178.4s] Like, I never want to dismiss him.
[6180.9s] No, but I don't think it's about him.
[6183.1s] I think it's in general.
[6184.9s] Like, we're, I think it's unknown territory that there's lots of questions.
[6189.4s] It's extremely good to be very skeptical of the AI.
[6193.4s] It really, it really is.
[6194.4s] Yeah.
[6194.9s] Just terrible, when you think about it, like a picture.
[6197.9s] Yeah.
[6198.9s] Just again to just go back to eligibility,
[6201.9s] because I just want to make sure if you're questions asked.
[6203.9s] Sure, yeah.
[6204.9s] Just be creative.
[6206.9s] Yes, of course, you have two years of consistent arts programming,
[6209.9s] whether it's telling stories in your community.
[6211.9s] You have, like, if you have a list anywhere of all the events,
[6216.9s] like who books all the different people that rent out the,
[6220.9s] rent out the old stuff?
[6221.9s] Yeah, either Jenner-Haley or, you know, whoever's
[6224.9s] claim those events and you just
[6226.9s] Yeah, yeah.
[6228.9s] Yeah, I know it is kind of up to interpretation, but.
[6232.9s] Yeah, even like we had a creative meetup there.
[6235.9s] We had an arts awards there.
[6237.9s] Yeah.
[6238.9s] I know it's...
[6239.9s] The meetup, I think, could be one that you could say,
[6242.9s] like a place where, you know,
[6244.9s] creatives convene and things like that.
[6246.9s] Yeah, another purpose of that question for the eligibility
[6250.9s] was about fiscal sponsorship if we did want to apply for
[6254.9s] a grant, are there avenues to, we don't have the two years yet, there's no way can we spin it?
[6259.9s] That's exactly why we often, we do offer, our physical
[6263.9s] sponsorship, deeply behind, just not, and deeply behind it is.
[6269.4s] Now and it's terrible about it.
[6271.4s] But it is a potential option if we come up with a really, really queer, awesome program
[6276.4s] that we want funding for.
[6277.4s] Yeah.
[6278.4s] Can you just apply through us?
[6279.4s] Okay.
[6280.4s] For one of programs, Gianna, it's no issue at all.
[6282.4s] It's, what's challenging is all the paperwork in the process I have.
[6285.4s] work in the process I have to go through with the Board of Directors.
[6288.4s] If someone wants to be permanently,
[6290.4s] but if someone just wants to do a grant,
[6294.4s] one-off, grant application, it's fine, it's easy.
[6297.4s] Well, they're 501, six the week.
[6299.4s] Yes, but you don't have the arts program.
[6301.4s] They don't have the credentials on that.
[6302.4s] They would apply as the Bad County Arts Council?
[6305.4s] Yes, they'd use our non-protechanged umbrella
[6308.4s] if they felt that they didn't have the two years of arts.
[6311.4s] Without it, yeah.
[6314.4s] Okay.
[6315.4s] This, I don't know that we really needed to talk about it.
[6316.4s] that we really needed to talk about it.
[6318.1s] But this was kind of more thinking that with your culture forward plan,
[6321.6s] because it read the whole culture forward plan,
[6323.6s] and then I asked it of the programs that we maybe have,
[6326.0s] what might serve the culture forward career pathways plan.
[6330.7s] So, you know.
[6331.6s] Great.
[6333.4s] Yeah.
[6334.2s] That's wonderful, isn't it?
[6336.9s] So yeah, having people, people are already coming in every Tuesday
[6340.5s] to work on the place if that was actually documented
[6344.1s] or presented in such a way as like some kind of
[6346.4s] micro-credential exam.
[6347.4s] That is a very interesting.
[6348.4s] Really interesting.
[6349.4s] Yeah.
[6350.4s] Yeah.
[6351.4s] Okay.
[6352.4s] So that's something to go down on.
[6353.4s] Yeah.
[6354.4s] It's almost like, I absolutely think that's right.
[6358.8s] Because when I think about as each of those six years goes by,
[6362.8s] like at the end of this year, Gianna, we're going to want to report back to our partners and publicly
[6371.8s] on our progression, which is one of the reasons that I really went for Artist Accelerator.
[6376.8s] Because I just wanted to front load the year with something we could report back on.
[6381.3s] And I'm so grateful that we have that.
[6383.8s] But, and then, of course, the business part does that.
[6386.8s] And there are other things, you know, like a collective education going up.
[6391.3s] We'll need to survey our other arts organizations to see it's not just about us.
[6396.3s] It's about what's music in the mountains offering.
[6398.8s] What's in lots of Sierra?
[6399.8s] What's the North Star offering in terms of education at all different levels?
[6404.3s] Yeah.
[6405.3s] So.
[6406.3s] So this will be part of a career, creative career pathways.
[6410.3s] Yeah, this is brilliant.
[6412.3s] Yeah.
[6413.3s] So it's almost like we need to start a spreadsheet that's mapping what people are doing in the board.
[6417.3s] In 2018, yeah, 2019 published the results in the survey
[6425.3s] in which we had interviewed every single school,
[6429.3s] transitional kindergarten through grade 12, you know, 12, that's called,
[6435.3s] into classroom,
[6437.3s] and we need to do that again.
[6443.3s] But we also surveyed arts education,
[6447.3s] because many of the non-profits are offering education
[6450.3s] of some kind like this.
[6452.3s] So, yeah, it's more surveying.
[6454.3s] Yeah.
[6455.3s] Yeah.
[6456.3s] I know.
[6457.3s] The whole Prop 28 thing, too,
[6460.3s] you know, the fact that they've got, what,
[6462.3s] $113 or something per student to,
[6465.3s] you hire art teachers and they can't hire art teachers.
[6471.3s] There's not enough.
[6472.3s] Oh.
[6473.3s] And so there's money that they have to spend.
[6475.3s] And so, you know, we have Jen, who's a,
[6477.3s] great with mosaics.
[6479.3s] Like, if we had a field trip where the kids showed up
[6481.3s] and learned mosaics from her and learned about the North Star House
[6484.3s] and there was some curriculum given to the schools beforehand
[6487.3s] and afterwards, would we be eligible for that kind of money?
[6490.3s] Would it help anything on your front when it comes to like you're saying,
[6493.3s] you need to come back and saying,
[6494.3s] and saying, we did this. This was a result of partner
[6498.3s] the North Star House on Culture Forward.
[6500.3s] Community, so it's not just us, it's the community, what's happening,
[6504.3s] it's moving the needle.
[6506.3s] Prop 28 is troubling for us.
[6509.3s] Is it, okay?
[6510.3s] And funnily enough, it destroyed our artists and schools program.
[6514.3s] We used to serve 2,000 kids a week year round in six different schools.
[6519.3s] Now we have served 800 because of Prop 28.
[6523.3s] Okay.
[6524.3s] It's kind of weird.
[6525.3s] A wolf in chiefs clothing.
[6527.3s] And now we are, and it's because of where we are placed in California,
[6534.3s] and the fact that Nevada County isn't quite underserved enough.
[6540.9s] It's doing things like three school,
[6542.9s] Title I and free school meals.
[6544.9s] Oh, interesting.
[6545.9s] So are you saying the money's in the budget that would go for artists in schools
[6550.9s] have been allocated more to property?
[6553.9s] I think.
[6554.9s] The money.
[6555.9s] that we were getting from schools.
[6558.9s] Oh, from the schools themselves, not from the state.
[6562.9s] The schools are now using that money.
[6566.9s] They don't need us anymore.
[6569.9s] They're just paying for something inside their schools.
[6575.9s] But what we're finding, if it were actually the case
[6579.9s] that they had been able to employ teachers to do it.
[6584.9s] short teaching ideas.
[6585.9s] Yes, but they're not.
[6586.9s] They're using the monies in different ways.
[6589.9s] And that's what this is about, is if you couldn't find a teacher, how do we get your money?
[6593.9s] Yes, exactly.
[6594.9s] And that's what we've tried to do, like NU called us and said, you know, we're looking
[6604.2s] for teaching artists, but they didn't want to work through our program.
[6608.2s] They only wanted a couple of hours to take a box, and then they go and spend it on something else.
[6614.2s] It's actually a scandal across Prop 208.
[6616.2s] Prop 28 is a disaster.
[6618.2s] Oh, wow.
[6619.2s] Because it didn't come with proper implementation recommendations.
[6622.2s] Plus, there's all these levels of the certification.
[6626.2s] Exactly.
[6627.2s] And yet they didn't come with a fast track certification solution from the state.
[6631.2s] So it's actually really awkward.
[6633.2s] So now our money comes from a completely different place.
[6636.2s] Okay.
[6637.2s] And it's not the same level.
[6639.2s] Right.
[6640.2s] But anyway.
[6641.2s] So, let me ponder that.
[6642.2s] I love that.
[6643.2s] What other question remains for?
[6645.2s] Oh yeah.
[6646.2s] We definitely already covered that.
[6647.5s] There's a lot of that we talked about that.
[6649.2s] This was just general offer of, you know, yes, we have a venue.
[6654.0s] There's a lot of empty space on the calendar.
[6655.8s] Please find out about internet.
[6657.8s] I will.
[6658.4s] I will, absolutely.
[6659.4s] Like high level of internet.
[6661.3s] Yeah, like would you have a minimum?
[6662.9s] Like, I would 300 megabits per second or something?
[6666.2s] I don't know.
[6667.2s] No, I'm such a idiot.
[6668.7s] I have no idea.
[6670.2s] All I know is like fast and slow.
[6672.5s] Sure, yeah, okay.
[6674.4s] I have a general idea of what is,
[6676.0s] intolerably slow.
[6678.0s] Okay.
[6679.0s] What's the creative exchange program?
[6681.0s] That is something that Haley, the very first meeting that we had on, like, December 8th,
[6685.0s] something that she was piloting, and immediately, like, made me scrimp my eyes and kind of shake my head internally.
[6691.0s] But maybe I'm not seeing it correctly.
[6693.0s] Her idea was that if you volunteered for 16 hours at the North Star House doing whatever,
[6699.0s] landscaping anything, you gained the right to a two-hour rental
[6706.0s] of the entire property.
[6709.0s] That's really cool.
[6710.0s] It's extremely generous and seems like a liability nightmare.
[6713.0s] But yeah, it is really cool if there is somebody.
[6716.0s] We could put a never-ending call for you on the,
[6721.0s] we frame it in a very humanity's rich way.
[6724.0s] The call to art is something.
[6726.0s] Okay.
[6727.0s] And like, who is coordinate, like the thing is like,
[6729.0s] there would need to be like 30 people there being like,
[6732.0s] please don't rip.
[6733.0s] Volunteer coordinators is like probably one of
[6736.0s] the most like extensive jobs as far as like the handling people like
[6743.0s] I don't know unless it's like very one-offs but like without a team and capacity
[6751.0s] yeah it sounds like I like the idea of it I think the artists will just show up and
[6756.3s] start doing things yeah where where's my you know yeah just Jackson Pollock the entire
[6761.2s] interior yeah said I got a carte blanche for two hours
[6766.0s] I don't think that would really happen, but yeah, there would need to be some sort of structure there that isn't in place yet.
[6771.0s] But...
[6772.0s] Well, it could be as simple as every Saturday morning between 9 and 1 or something.
[6782.0s] Someone is there, a docent or something, is there to welcome people with doughnuts and coffee,
[6789.0s] and who then sets them, okay, you're going to do them there, do that we do that, you're going to clean that sign.
[6795.0s] on them.
[6796.0s] But then when it comes to coordinating the moment that they want to use the space.
[6801.0s] Oh.
[6802.0s] That's the part that I feel like, that's crazy.
[6804.0s] How do you control that?
[6806.0s] Yeah.
[6807.0s] Yeah, how you vet them beforehand.
[6809.0s] It would be like scheduling, like, yeah.
[6811.0s] Yeah, held and safe.
[6812.0s] Or it could, and the insurance involved.
[6814.0s] Yeah, it's like you're giving them a lot.
[6816.0s] Yeah, two hours is a whole property.
[6818.0s] It's like why, you could just volunteer for 16 hours and then throw your wedding there.
[6822.0s] And then totally not have to pay the venue.
[6824.0s] to pay the venue calls if you want technically, I mean, it's very open-ended.
[6828.0s] That was Haley's idea and it, yeah.
[6831.0s] It's a sweet idea.
[6832.0s] It is sweet, but it could be more like one hour and then you know that any large event
[6837.0s] could possibly happen in one hour.
[6839.0s] Yeah, or something very sandbox.
[6841.0s] You can do these things for two hours.
[6843.0s] Yeah, right.
[6844.0s] Exactly.
[6845.0s] You can have a one-hour meeting in the southern...
[6848.0s] Yeah, the conference room.
[6850.0s] Or you can sit on the verandah if you were.
[6852.0s] Right.
[6853.0s] Yeah.
[6854.0s] Yeah.
[6856.0s] Okay.
[6857.0s] Well, that was all the questions.
[6858.0s] It didn't do the thing, huh?
[6860.0s] Well, I don't know if it did it or not.
[6862.0s] I think that it did do it, but I don't know what happened to it.
[6865.0s] But I don't know what happened to it.
[6869.0s] I think it got pulled down.
[6871.0s] I think in general, with all these, most of these funding sources that you've
[6881.6s] brilliant found, it just start to learn yourself, and you'll be a very,
[6886.6s] and you'll be of value if you work on this lexicon anyway.
[6893.6s] But what does understanding, the idea of multiple equity letters,
[6898.6s] I know that when I'm writing a grant, and I don't really use,
[6903.6s] I have started using it more, but I'm highly selected with writing,
[6912.9s] but I always try to think of things through multiple different,
[6917.9s] Yeah.
[6918.9s] Is it land equity?
[6921.9s] Is it geographic?
[6922.9s] Is it people?
[6923.9s] Is it gender?
[6925.9s] Is it whatever?
[6927.9s] Yeah.
[6928.9s] Yeah.
[6929.9s] And I will be that.
[6930.9s] I mean, it would be so cool to actually have conversations with people who are experts
[6935.9s] in that particular lens.
[6937.9s] And then for future reference, just record conversations with them and then maybe build a
[6942.9s] person, you know, a certain file around them to where it's like,
[6945.9s] now look at this from a life.
[6946.9s] from Eliza's perspective and it would have some tiny little snippet of, you know,
[6951.9s] what Eliza's ideas of...
[6953.9s] It's normally I sent to the team an email which I want to...
[6957.9s] I'm going to put it in the staff meeting in general because we need to be leading
[6960.9s] grant writing workshops.
[6962.9s] Oh yeah.
[6963.9s] So, and that actually the most would be an ideal place for us to leave a grant writing workshop
[6969.9s] where we're offering free for artists and arts organizations the opportunity to come and hear.
[6975.9s] here from the expense on writing grounds.
[6979.9s] Right.
[6980.9s] And then...
[6981.9s] I think if you go up, we can see, because we asked for public art, right?
[6985.9s] I don't know.
[6986.9s] I can't remember what you actually had asked for.
[6988.9s] Yeah, we did.
[6989.9s] So if you click on just public art.
[6990.9s] Yeah, click on that.
[6992.9s] And then it did 10 or something.
[6994.9s] Oh.
[6995.9s] It's not looking like it actually put it in there.
[6998.9s] But it looks like it was thinking about it.
[7000.9s] Something is there.
[7001.9s] Maybe click on it?
[7002.9s] It's...
[7003.9s] It looks like it's a public art.
[7004.9s] It's like a public garden sort of preservation.
[7006.9s] It's doing something.
[7008.9s] We'll let it cook for a minute.
[7010.9s] But this, I love the idea.
[7014.9s] Like, anything you can do is, like, this map I'm really interested in,
[7019.9s] because the interface that we, the new interface,
[7023.9s] looks so ugly, it's deeply functional, but so ugly.
[7027.9s] Yeah.
[7028.9s] Yeah, the first thing that I noticed when I was looking at
[7031.9s] was like, I'm not really sure what problem this is,
[7033.9s] this is solving, so.
[7036.9s] That's what we've, yeah.
[7037.9s] It's great to have it there, but like, and.
[7040.9s] Yeah, right.
[7041.9s] Who's using it?
[7042.9s] I'm always thinking about the people, right?
[7045.9s] So, like, we imported, say we imported our entire
[7048.9s] business directory, which is in news,
[7051.9s] which has categories, you know, like eating and drinking,
[7055.9s] which is somewhat similar to
[7058.9s] yeah, places to eat, drink and stay.
[7062.9s] Right.
[7063.4s] But then you can start building an interface that actually pulls experiences together
[7068.4s] and things like that.
[7070.4s] Based on the data that you put in, not like how VTT is like...
[7075.4s] Feet is experienced out of the net.
[7077.4s] From...
[7078.4s] From what it's already in there.
[7080.4s] Yeah.
[7082.4s] Wow, that would be very interesting.
[7084.4s] Like seriously well researched data points.
[7087.4s] Like we've done so much research here.
[7090.4s] Yeah.
[7091.4s] So...
[7092.4s] It's great to hear you tell you.
[7093.4s] talk about it and already, like I can see the creative juices flowing on that front.
[7097.9s] And yeah, Claude Code is so cool.
[7099.9s] It's like, I have an idea.
[7100.9s] Oh my God, that's going to be a nightmare.
[7102.9s] When that's not there anymore, it is so fun.
[7105.4s] It is so fun to just see what you had in your head.
[7109.4s] Why don't you do the project?
[7111.7s] I would love to.
[7112.7s] Yeah, I would really love to.
[7113.7s] And this is getting better and better and better.
[7115.7s] I haven't now.
[7117.2s] And what could do?
[7118.2s] Oh, there, it happened.
[7123.2s] So it's actually over here on the left.
[7125.2s] It has the ability now because of the skill that I downloaded.
[7128.2s] you know.
[7129.2s] And it's chosen in a new picture.
[7130.2s] It knows what work it was supposed to do.
[7132.2s] It goes and looks itself and analyzes to see, did it get done?
[7137.2s] No, it didn't get done.
[7138.2s] So it looks at how it implemented it and then finds its own errors.
[7142.2s] It's getting better and better.
[7144.2s] Can you click on that real quick just to see the side window?
[7147.2s] Yeah.
[7154.0s] I love that.
[7155.0s] I love the like editorial.
[7157.0s] Yeah, it does look like muse.
[7159.0s] I think that's probably, that's possibly because maybe,
[7163.0s] maybe.
[7164.0s] Ania intentionally chose Muse for that reason, too.
[7169.0s] Anyway, that's our design of them, Muse.
[7172.0s] Well, so what's the next step?
[7175.0s] So I want you to feel that, we want you to feel that you're getting something from,
[7182.0s] I mean, I hope you're going away tonight with sort of like,
[7185.0s] Oh yeah, absolutely.
[7186.0s] Yes.
[7187.0s] What I really wanted is it's so easy to sit there and brainstorm and then imagine
[7193.0s] the implementation of it and then try and imagine what grants that makes me, you know,
[7198.0s] eligible for and just go down a rabbit hole over and over and over.
[7202.0s] And I just want to land on something to focus on.
[7205.0s] Like this is where I'm actually putting my energy.
[7208.0s] Well, yes, I mean, for you guys, but, but for the North Star House.
[7213.0s] Oh, yes, because they're so full of, it's so full of random ideas.
[7218.0s] Yeah, it's just, it's completely blank space.
[7221.0s] Yeah.
[7222.0s] Yes. Yeah.
[7223.0s] Yes, and because they're so young, they have no benchmarks.
[7227.0s] Isn't it lovely?
[7229.0s] Yeah.
[7230.0s] I like their part.
[7232.0s] So it would do, you could come back in the morning.
[7235.0s] It still has to, the long, the thing that takes the longest is it actually,
[7238.0s] you know, surfacing on the internet, the assets, the pictures,
[7244.0s] and things like that, but.
[7245.0s] Will this just all stop once you close your laptop?
[7249.0s] It would, but there are, there are, you know,
[7253.0s] very easy things you can set up to where it's running in the cloud.
[7256.0s] You can put your entire project up onto GitHub
[7260.0s] and then just send messages from your phone to be like,
[7264.0s] hey, I got this new information, can you incorporate it into the website,
[7267.0s] send, and then you just go to sleep and it's working,
[7270.0s] and it's doing its thing.
[7271.0s] Yeah, the cultural corridor.
[7275.5s] Have you ever used notebook LM either of you?
[7278.5s] It's another AI thing.
[7280.5s] It's through, it's...
[7281.5s] Like, you know, what?
[7284.5s] Notebook LM is something.
[7285.5s] really great if you're trying to internalize information, I mean, it would be, have been wonderful while I was in school, but I used it, you know, before this meeting.
[7293.0s] Last night, I uploaded information and I had it take all the sources that I gave it and create a podcast about, you know, culture forward, about, like, your, your, what the arts council about a county, like, really does in general and what, you know, how you might be able to help out, and then I, I listened to it, and it's really great, but it said something.
[7315.5s] about, you know, I'm getting information third hand from a podcast that got it third hand from something else, so I, you know, will often come to meetings like this and say, I heard this thing. It's like the equivalent of hearing it on the street.
[7327.5s] But yeah, the cultural corridor thing, it for some reason thought that North Star House was going to solve this geographic problem of trying to link east and west. It seemed nuts to me, and like I probably just didn't actually understand what the North Star was in the world. But what is that?
[7345.5s] What is that that that you're talking about?
[7347.1s] Yeah.
[7348.3s] So, for the longest time, and I've been imposed for ten years, it's time I've disappeared somewhere, but
[7356.1s] but...
[7357.8s] Please don't.
[7358.8s] At least not right now.
[7360.8s] For the longest time, I have felt, so on a very personal level, I felt, so on a very personal level, I felt that my job is quite lonely because, because as the county arts agency, um, connecting,
[7375.5s] the state with our local government, even though we're a 501c3 non-profit organization.
[7382.2s] It's so lonely that so much of my work over in the eastern part of the county is completely unrecognized.
[7389.6s] I don't know, you know, it's taken me years to develop relationships up there, and it's now incredible that we have an office.
[7396.4s] But the two communities barely talk to each other, other than the artists.
[7400.9s] The artists are actually finally enough the most connected of all sectors across the whole.
[7405.5s] county they don't care whether they're in grass valley the well environment the
[7409.5s] environmental sector is pretty connected yes yes true true true yeah so um but certainly government and
[7417.2s] business is totally separate so so we thought it would be just fantastic we more explicitly
[7428.1s] named and what all our assets or entities or historical landmarks or trailheads the heritage sites or ruins yes
[7444.1s] That's exactly, like what crazy, funky, weird things exist that people could stop at and have a look at.
[7450.8s] Like, I discovered the other day that there's a brave of a three-year-old as you drive way up, six miles down the road up towards a trucking, and it marks the site of the death of the three-year-old who is part of the Donner Party.
[7467.8s] And it's just the sweetest thing.
[7469.2s] That's on the 20.
[7470.5s] Yeah, and it's probably on this map.
[7474.0s] But anyway, so we.
[7475.7s] We, and like, is there, like, is there any cafes along here, like, other, there's a, there's a, there used to be a Donner, historical museum, I think it might be re-opening again.
[7486.9s] And there's a five-mile house, and then there's a five-mile house.
[7489.4s] Harmony Ridge.
[7490.4s] Harmony Ridge, which is amazing.
[7492.2s] Rainbow Lodge.
[7492.9s] Rainbow Lodge, yeah.
[7493.9s] Yeah.
[7495.6s] So, anyway, so that's where we, we thought, let's build a map in that one.
[7500.8s] It's part of, um, culture, is that?
[7504.2s] It's like building a map that.
[7505.7s] connect these two communities that it's almost like that corridor exists right there's
[7513.2s] but yeah but that's the only medium is just a visual on a map or would there be
[7518.6s] something actually infrastructure was so so right now it's like we're parting the
[7525.4s] waves you know what I mean so you can see through to the other side yeah and so that
[7531.2s] there's no othering that's going on there's just awareness there's awareness
[7535.2s] So it's really, very, very, we didn't mean to take it so far.
[7539.2s] A classic example.
[7539.7s] We thought we'd do it in the future, but then we thought, why not?
[7542.0s] We'll just do it now.
[7542.8s] It took a lot of work.
[7543.8s] And a classic example is like Seven Hills, how it connects both.
[7547.7s] Yeah.
[7548.1s] Like how these are two incorporated communities, Ragrat Valley, Nevada City, and then there's Seven Hills that sometimes gets left out, right?
[7557.2s] But when you feel that, when you feel that idea of like it's a corridor, the people that connect these two incorporated,
[7565.2s] cities that people are moving through one and the other utilizing that route even, you know,
[7571.2s] like maybe there's a gas station that they can fill gas in the Seven Hills and then from there,
[7577.2s] like, community starts to build.
[7579.2s] So I think also...
[7583.0s] It's very much of the, so what's, how does it become a tool, how do we promote it,
[7588.0s] how do we draw in other partners who are doing interesting things?
[7592.0s] Like, do we start having events up there, like the thing that's most obviously,
[7597.0s] between the two California cultural districts is Rainbow Lodge.
[7601.0s] Like, can we open it out one night, have a special there?
[7604.0s] There's an art gallery, too, you know?
[7607.0s] Yeah.
[7608.0s] Naseel gallery.
[7609.0s] That's right, that's right, yeah.
[7611.0s] So, and I never knew that before we started doing this.
[7613.0s] Yeah, me neither.
[7615.0s] We discover these.
[7616.0s] There's a museum, there's an entire, like, way-finding museum that you can follow and, like,
[7622.0s] visit all these locations, like,
[7625.0s] with all of the history.
[7626.0s] the history, like the local history.
[7629.8s] So how do we bring the idea to Liza?
[7632.8s] It's not just the static map that you can see in news.
[7635.8s] Like, what does that look like?
[7637.8s] Is it a map?
[7638.8s] Yeah, I would love to also show you.
[7641.8s] It's one of the main things that I use this for is, yeah,
[7645.8s] it's brainstorming capabilities.
[7648.8s] So fantastic.
[7650.8s] Everything that you just said there, if you had said it to it,
[7653.8s] it would just be asking clarifying questions.
[7656.8s] Why don't you...
[7659.1s] some of these ideas and then help you sell yourself as a consultant, but not
[7663.1s] before saving the future of Nevada County Arts Council.
[7667.1s] Yeah, if it's in general, I would love to help.
[7669.1s] Yeah, I would love to help in general.
[7671.1s] That would be very, very cool.
[7673.1s] And if you want to set up something, because I've got, you know,
[7676.1s] a decent amount of information, I can come back with some ideas,
[7679.1s] but I do really want, I want to at least show you, like,
[7683.1s] how to use clock code.
[7685.1s] If we do, we're just beginning to sort of think about it,
[7688.1s] think about it because we haven't wanted to,
[7690.1s] we've been so utterly inundated.
[7692.1s] Like, do we do a business of art this year?
[7694.1s] Do we not? That would be in the full.
[7696.1s] And then if we do, we're going to be looking to present us,
[7699.1s] so it might be nice for you to think,
[7701.1s] if by September you're ready to present your services to the community
[7706.1s] and you know that you're going to have 150 people in the room,
[7709.1s] artists and group, what would a session,
[7712.1s] one hour session look like, led by you,
[7715.1s] that would be a value for artists.
[7717.1s] Yeah. I mean, it's also a lot of people.
[7718.1s] something I could pile it up the North Star House is actually just
[7721.1s] teach a little class there.
[7722.6s] Totally.
[7723.1s] And I end going...
[7724.1s] That is popped up.
[7725.1s] Yeah, right?
[7726.1s] We could present it.
[7727.1s] Like, present it by the Model County Outs Council,
[7730.1s] one mill-starring, collaboration in the other County House Council.
[7733.1s] That'd be very cool.
[7734.1s] You can help promote it, yeah.
[7736.1s] Sure.
[7737.1s] He went to Ken Krookler's.
[7739.1s] Yeah, and I actually signed up for his...
[7741.1s] Did you like that?
[7742.1s] How was it for you?
[7743.1s] It, I mean, for me, I could see other people were having fun.
[7746.1s] Other people really were getting fun.
[7748.1s] getting something out of it.
[7750.1s] But for me, it was nothing that I felt you couldn't learn
[7755.1s] just through being a bull in a china shop for 10 minutes with ChatGPT.
[7760.1s] If you were slightly curious about how it worked, you might ask ChatGPT, how does this work?
[7765.1s] That was the whole class.
[7767.1s] The answer that you would have gotten back from ChatGPT interacting with it.
[7770.1s] It was just so, so basic that I found it hard to believe that someone was walking out of it
[7777.1s] with really something.
[7778.1s] valuable, but maybe they were, if they had experienced nothing, if it demystified it in some way, if it allowed them to, you know, satisfy a curiosity.
[7785.1s] You know, it's so interesting, because we all have different learning things,
[7788.1s] for example, much trouble personally, keeping up with the latest
[7794.4s] workspace, technical things that I need to keep up with.
[7798.4s] Yeah.
[7799.4s] But I have this complete blind spot with, for example, can be.
[7804.4s] For some reason, I just haven't got my...
[7807.4s] I know that I need to.
[7808.4s] I know that I need to.
[7809.4s] I know that I want to.
[7810.4s] It's just that you haven't done.
[7812.4s] No, no.
[7813.4s] So here, I just want to say this to Kaylee, because Kalin,
[7816.4s] if there were a workshop that I could attend for a day,
[7820.4s] led by an idiot on Canada, that would make me so happy and I would learn about it,
[7825.4s] and then I would never want to go again.
[7827.4s] But you wouldn't...
[7828.4s] But for some reason, even though I know I could learn that online,
[7831.4s] I'm completely stuck.
[7833.4s] Like, I can't even think.
[7835.4s] I don't know what...
[7836.4s] I understand what you mean.
[7837.4s] I can just show you like five minutes.
[7838.4s] Yeah.
[7839.4s] Oh, my God.
[7840.4s] I attended that Ken Krugler one, and I had the same feelings, and I remember asking a question
[7845.6s] that was slightly nuanced about the ethics and guidance and policy and being an umbrella agency,
[7852.9s] and he just wasn't up for answering the question with any...
[7855.9s] Yeah.
[7856.9s] And I asked him also about Claude, you know, like, if you're not using something that exists in the terminal like this does,
[7862.4s] you're kind of, you're going to be left behind, and he just wasn't interested.
[7865.4s] I can't know my password is, but I'll actually deploy this site and say,
[7869.4s] you, the link.
[7870.4s] Okay.
[7871.4s] You can continue to look at it and, you know, get inspired by it.
[7875.4s] Yeah.
[7876.4s] But, yeah, when it comes to Canva, actually, with Claude Code, you just, you...
[7882.4s] I will show you, or either, you know, we talk about it more at length.
[7886.4s] But yeah, you can connect Claude Code to Canva.
[7888.4s] I just felt so stupid, I...
[7892.1s] This is it.
[7893.1s] It's all of me.
[7894.1s] Suddenly I...
[7895.1s] Did, I couldn't learn Snapchat.
[7896.1s] Some of them just have confusing user interfaces.
[7900.1s] No.
[7901.1s] But yeah, you, I can just, I think I'd disconnect the MCP server because I wasn't using it, but there's very easy ways in which you would just use natural language.
[7910.1s] Here's what I want.
[7911.1s] Connect to Canva, give it to me.
[7913.1s] You wouldn't even ever need to look at the Canva website.
[7915.1s] It will talk to Canva.
[7916.1s] It will import back into you.
[7918.1s] Because you want the challenge or...
[7920.1s] I can know how to use that.
[7923.1s] I can show you in five minutes.
[7925.1s] Can you just give me a session?
[7927.1s] It's just because you don't use it.
[7929.1s] Like pay you overtime and you can't have it.
[7930.1s] Okay.
[7931.1s] I'll work out a deal.
[7933.1s] Seriously, I will show you, you'll be like, you will be like, oh my God.
[7939.1s] I have done some things. I can go in and edit something. It's already there.
[7943.1s] It's starting from scratch that's the hardest for me.
[7946.1s] Okay.
[7947.1s] I have used it. I've corrected some things.
[7949.1s] I use it so basic.
[7951.1s] Yeah.
[7952.1s] I'm sure there's like way more that people do on there.
[7955.1s] But like, yeah.
[7957.1s] But I suppose...
[7958.1s] I'm starving, you guys.
[7960.1s] Defending.
[7961.1s] the people in the room who went to see Ken because I thought,
[7965.1s] my God, he's only going to be able to last so long
[7970.1s] because he's so not with it.
[7973.1s] He's only, he'll be able to, he can do this now
[7977.1s] because there's been an explosion and it's just at the beginning,
[7980.1s] but soon everyone in the room will have outpaced him.
[7983.1s] Do you know what I mean?
[7984.1s] And I signed up for the grant writing one.
[7987.1s] And yeah, I'll all attend it.
[7989.1s] When is it?
[7990.1s] I'm not sure.
[7991.1s] It's like the 12th or something.
[7992.1s] Definitely good.
[7993.1s] I'm very curious because...
[7994.1s] I'll sign up.
[7995.1s] Because my world is groundbreaking.
[7998.1s] Yeah.
[7999.1s] I won't be shy this time.
[8000.1s] Because now I have some sort of official capacity in the nonprofit world.
[8004.1s] I can say like...
[8006.1s] What about this?
[8007.1s] Yeah, like, man, I'm actually doing this.
[8010.1s] I have written a grant, I've made a database.
[8013.1s] What you're...
[8014.1s] You're not teaching these people what they need to know.
[8016.1s] When is it?
[8017.1s] And then we'll have to cross it afterwards.
[8019.1s] So when is it?
[8020.1s] I don't know.
[8021.1s] Yeah.
[8024.1s] We should just sign up.
[8029.1s] Just sign up, yeah.
[8031.1s] Yeah, we can wrap this up and
[8037.1s] there doesn't need to be behind.
[8039.1s] Yeah.
[8041.1s] So, yeah.
[8043.1s] So AI for grants.
[8053.2s] So, AI for grants.
[8058.6s] February, well,
[8059.6s] February 12.
[8060.6s] Oh, 10 AM.
[8061.6s] Is that in office?
[8066.2s] Where is this?
[8067.2s] Oh, is it not a Zoom thing?
[8069.2s] I can't go.
[8070.2s] Oh, maybe so.
[8071.2s] Oh, come to our first online.
[8073.2s] Yeah, that's what I thought.
[8074.2s] Zoom.
[8075.2s] Thursdays are very...
[8077.2s] Yeah, we're going to...
[8079.2s] Hack all right.
[8080.2s] I can send to the list.
[8083.2s] Thank you very much.
[8085.2s] Thank you.
[8086.2s] Thank you so much, Kaelin.
[8087.2s] Thank you.
[8088.2s] Thank you so much, Kaelin.
[8091.2s] Thank you.
[8092.2s] Thank you so much, Kaelin.
[8095.2s] Absolutely.
[8096.2s] That was a long meeting.
[8098.2s] We had a lot.
[8099.2s] We had a lot.
[8101.2s] Yeah, but that was great information.
[8103.2s] Yeah.
[8104.2s] A lot that I can actually work on over the weekend, which is exactly what I wanted,
[8107.2s] is just some lanes, some defined lanes.
[8111.2s] Yeah.
[8113.5s] And.
[8114.5s] If you want to get yourself signed up for Claude and then let me know, I can kind of walk you through getting it installed in the terminal.
[8125.5s] So it's...
[8126.5s] So it can...
[8129.5s] Claude code.
[8130.5s] But you're on a Mac.
[8131.5s] So you might be more interested in what's called Claude Co-pilot.
[8134.5s] Recently, Anthropic, who is the parent company of Claude...
[8139.5s] What is called Clod?
[8141.5s] Claude...
[8142.5s] Claude Co-pilot?
[8143.5s] All of us are on that.
[8145.5s] Then Claude Co-pilot would probably...
[8146.5s] be a little bit, I wouldn't be able to be as much of a t-shirt because I don't use it.
[8151.5s] But you would probably be able to extrapolate great benefit just from it.
[8157.5s] And yeah, you figure it out on your own too.
[8159.5s] But Claude Co-Work is for the Mac with a more beautiful user interface.
[8163.5s] Yeah.
[8168.0s] Yeah.
[8171.0s] Yeah.
[8172.0s] I used to work in film for a few years and that's going to do for what you know.
[8179.4s] Yeah.
[8180.4s] Well, I am somewhat regreted you having purchase.
[8183.4s] this before I knew that I was really going to be mobile with it.
[8186.4s] It's more of a powerhouse that can do other video stuff.
[8190.4s] But, and for the price, I feel like Mac is great,
[8193.4s] but usually not paying like 50% more.
[8195.4s] For what seems to be the same thing, seems to be at the same windows.
[8199.4s] Oh.
[8200.4s] Usually is that.
[8201.4s] Yeah.
[8204.6s] So, as Mac is kind of being in the cold, you'll...
[8208.6s] The home, yeah?
[8210.6s] These people are also not cold.
[8214.6s] Yeah.
[8215.6s] Well, I do that.
[8216.6s] My dad and my brother.
[8219.6s] Yeah.
[8220.6s] Try.
[8221.6s] If you game, I think, or if you want to actually get into the guts of a computer and change it,
[8227.6s] if you're on that technical side of things, I think PC is a little easier.
[8231.6s] If you look at an Android phone versus an Apple phone, Apple is beautiful and it's easy to use.
[8236.6s] It's intuitive.
[8238.6s] Android is a mess, but you can do whatever you want with it.
[8242.6s] You can customize it for whatever.
[8244.6s] No, totally.
[8245.6s] Yeah.
[8246.6s] Apple Gate keeps.
[8247.6s] You know if you guys, everybody's team means at the North Star?
[8252.6s] I have my copy, but if you, well, yeah, I mean, Jen and Haley were there.
[8259.6s] Okay.
[8260.6s] Yeah.
[8261.6s] And the board?
[8262.6s] I'm not honestly sure how active the board is.
[8264.6s] I really don't know how involved they are.
[8266.6s] Okay.
[8267.6s] I don't want, yeah.
[8268.6s] I don't want to say one way or the other.
[8270.6s] Do they go to the North Carolina sometimes?
[8273.6s] Yeah, I think sometimes.
[8274.6s] Yeah.
[8275.6s] meetings, but it's kind of part of the tiger camp.
[8282.6s] Yeah.
[8283.6s] Some people have like four hours, like in a month, a volunteer hour that they had to travel.
[8288.6s] Yeah.
[8289.6s] Well, thank you so much.
[8291.6s] Yeah, of course.
[8292.6s] Very insightful.
[8294.6s] Yeah, I'm about it.
[8295.6s] I was actually like exciting for the math.
[8299.6s] I really wasn't sure if I had some faith.
[8301.6s] But I've had some faith.
[8302.6s] My boy Claudeco does a pretty good job most of the time.
[8304.6s] Yeah.
[8305.6s] Yeah, that was, yeah, that was serious.
[8307.6s] Yeah.
[8308.6s] Yeah.
[8309.6s] So get it?
[8310.6s] Yeah, we'll talk more about it.
[8311.6s] Yeah, that was good.
[8312.6s] Yeah.
[8313.6s] Cool.
[8314.6s] All right.
[8315.6s] Oh yeah.
[8316.6s] Yeah, that's nice.
[8318.6s] I took it already.
[8319.6s] Yeah.
[8320.6s] Yeah.
[8321.6s] Yeah.
[8322.6s] You guys had a little.
[8323.6s] Yeah, I need to go eat.
[8326.6s] Bye.
[8327.6s] Bye.
[8328.6s] Bye.
[8329.6s] Where did I come.
[8331.6s] See you can.
[8332.6s] Lovely to meet your side.
[8334.6s] Lovely to meet you again.
[8335.6s] We're going to meet you.
[8336.6s] Yeah, I'll be working on.
[8338.6s] Yeah, I'll be working on.
[8340.6s] What's your next time?
[8343.6s] With your beautiful daughter.
[8346.6s] What's she called?
[8347.6s] Bronwyn, and she might actually be out of town.
[8349.6s] Very Welsh, the name.
[8351.6s] Yes.
[8352.6s] Did you know that?
[8353.6s] Yes, we did.
[8354.6s] Okay.
[8355.6s] I'm half Welsh, so I do.
[8360.8s] Yeah, nobody can pin that one down to the first person to go.
[8363.8s] the first person to go to her person before.
[8365.8s] Oh.
[8369.8s] Oh.
[8370.8s] That's quite nice to do.
[8372.8s] Bye.
[8373.8s] Bye.
