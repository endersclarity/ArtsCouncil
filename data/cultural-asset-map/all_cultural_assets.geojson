It is centered on the villages of Chicago Park and Peardale. Prior to the 1840s, this area was populated by the Nisenan. In August 1849, what is reported to have been Nevada County's second store was erected on land overlooking the junction of the Bear River and Greenhorn Creek. In the 1850s, local residents led by Simmon Storms succeeded in having the Nisenan removed to a reservation near Tehama. During that period, Benjamin Taylor settled on a ranch in the area which he named Buena Vista, after the Mexican War battle in which he had participated, and engaged in farming and horse breeding. Others who settled in the area found it very suitable for growing fruit, especially pears.\rIn 1872, the Coleman Brothers purchased the Buena Vista and Storms ranches, and other properties in the area, as they were developing the Nevada County Narrow Gauge Railroad. Completed in 1876, the Railroad spurred the agricultural development of the area. In 1887, a group of Colfax and Chicago, Illinois developers acquired several thousand acres of land and drew up plans for the Chicago Park Colony. The Colony was to consist of 20 and 40 acre tracts as well as town lots laid out around a public square with streets named for prominent streets in Chicago. Much of the planned development never materialized, but reportedly almost 7000 acres were sold, principally to residents of Chicago. Many of the tracts were planted with orchards, and the area was referred to as the Bartlett Pear Belt. The railroad station at Storms Station was renamed Chicago Park Station, There were also stations at Buena Vista and Peardale. Fruit was king in the area for about 100-years. Orchards growing pears, plums, peaches and apples were everywhere. Because water was not abundant, dry farming techniques were mastered which improved fruit color. In 1915, local Bartlett pears were honored at the Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco.

When Olympia Park, located at the south end of the basin, opened in 1901, Glenbrook Basin became the recreational center of Nevada County and much of Northern California, and remained so for over fifty years. People would come to the basin by horse and buggy or later the automobile, but those wishing for a little more excitement would often use the Nevada County Traction Company\u2019s trolley, or the Nevada County Narrow Gauge Railroad. The large grandstands of the three-quarter-mile racetrack stood near the junction of present Brunswick Road and Sutton Way. Trotting, pacing, and running horse races were held at the track, and motor car races began in 1913. The racetrack was one of the first electrically lighted racetracks in the state. A dam was constructed just northeast of the existing electrical substation to form Lake Olympia. The lake soon became one of the Basin\u00cds main attractions. Located in the center of Lake Olympia was an island with a pavilion which had a coil-spring-mounted dance floor that swayed with the rhythm of the dancers' feet. There was swimming, boating and fishing in Lake Olympia, and during some winters there was ice skating. There were boats and bathing suits for rent, and the park contained a bathhouse, a roller skating rink, and a bar. Many a romance blossomed on the lake during an evening boat ride under the stars. Families rented cabins and picnicked in the shade of the large pine trees along the shores of Lake Olympia. Olympia Park was the site of high school commencements, football and baseball games, and special events such as fat ladies' races and freckled-face children contests. The annual miners' picnics were held at the park with mucking and drilling contests, tug-of-wars and Cornish wrestling, as refreshments of various kinds flowed freely. Olympia Park fell into disrepair in the 1950s and ceased operation in 1958.

These courageous pioneers were the first emigrants to take wagons over the Sierra Nevada, opening the Truckee Route of the California Trail. The Murphy, Townsend, Miller, and Hitchcock families formed the main groups of the party. Caleb Greenwood was the hired guide, and Elisha Stephens was elected Captain of the wagon train. After following the Oregon Trail to Fort Hall, Idaho, they turned away from the well-worn path and headed west into the unfamiliar Nevada desert. A Paiute Indian Chief showed them how to reach a river flowing from the Sierra Nevada, which they named 'Truckee' in his honor. Overcoming severe conditions, they followed the Truckee River to the base of the Sierra. Six members, on horseback, continued to follow the Truckee River and eventually arrived safely at Sutter's New Helvetia on December 10, 1844. Six of the wagons were left in the charge of two men, and young Moses Schallenberger, near Truckee Lake (present Donner Lake). Near this spot, with two feet of snow on the ground, they worked the remaining five wagons across the summit of the mighty Sierra Nevada on November 25, 1844. Deepening snow forced them to camp near Big Bend, on the South Yuba River. Leaving the wagons with two men and the women and children, the remaining 17 men continued on to New Helvetia to seek help. Somehow, John Sutter persuaded the men to enlist in his forces taking part in a Mexican civil war.
