While further details about Mr. Anthony are unknown, the name Anthony House prevailed through a succession of owners. The property was up for sale in 1852 and purchased by Mr. S. P. French. By that time it was a flourishing stage stop, serving as a hotel, restaurant, livery stable and post office. The original house burned down in 1876 but was quickly rebuilt. Subsequent owners included William Henry Davey, Nevada County Supervisor 1908-1916 and later his son, Frank Davey. Stage stop and post office operations continued to 1906 when the post office was moved to Smartsville. Thereafter, declining traffic on the trade route led to farming and cattle raising as the main use of the property. By 1970 when Boise Cascade began development of this area, the property had fallen into disrepair and the house was burned down as a training exercise by the Penn Valley Fire Protection District.

The first house, still standing in the 1930’s, had deteriorated and was razed. The well, located in the front porch of the house remains. The barn now extended on both ends, still exists. The Hartungs built the current house in 1889. Pear, apple and walnut crops became the primary means of support for the family. A few of the original pear trees remain. Nevada August Hartung was born in August 1853 on the shores of Webber Lake, California in a wagon train on the family's way west from Illinois. It is reported that Nevada's given name was the result of the parents’ awe at their first sight of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. He grew up on his father Adolph Hartung's farm at Kentucky Flat and married Emma Schwartz in 1880. By the time of their 1888 purchase of the property, the Hartungs had three children, Frank (b.1880), Herman (b. 1884) and Mamie (b. 1886). The Hartungs bought the farm from Samuel and Agnes Yeo (owners 1888-1888) and prior to that the property was owned by Joseph Peers (1886-1888) and the Saxons (ca.1860-1886). In 1849-1850, John Rose and William Reynolds operated a trading post and cattle corral, both thought to be located on what became the Hartung property.

Historic Landmarks,Chicago Park Historic Agricultural Community,Along Hwy 174 between the Bear River and Brunswick Rd,,,,,,"The Chicago Park Historic Agricultural Community occupies roughly the area on either side of Highway 174 between the Bear River and Brunswick Road. It is centered on the villages of Chicago Park and Peardale. Prior to the 1840s, this area was populated by the Nisenan. In August 1849, what is reported to have been Nevada County's second store was erected on land overlooking the junction of the Bear River and Greenhorn Creek. In the 1850s, local residents led by Simmon Storms succeeded in having the Nisenan removed to a reservation near Tehama. During that period, Benjamin Taylor settled on a ranch in the area which he named Buena Vista, after the Mexican War battle in which he had participated, and engaged in farming and horse breeding. Others who settled in the area found it very suitable for growing fruit, especially pears.In 1872, the Coleman Brothers purchased the Buena Vista and Storms ranches, and other properties in the area, as they were developing the Nevada County Narrow Gauge Railroad. Completed in 1876, the Railroad spurred the agricultural development of the area. In 1887, a group of Colfax and Chicago, Illinois developers acquired several thousand acres of land and drew up plans for the Chicago Park Colony. The Colony was to consist of 20 and 40 acre tracts as well as town lots laid out around a public square with streets named for prominent streets in Chicago. Much of the planned development never materialized, but reportedly almost 7000 acres were sold, principally to residents of Chicago. Many of the tracts were planted with orchards, and the area was referred to as the Bartlett Pear Belt. The railroad station at Storms Station was renamed Chicago Park Station, There were also stations at Buena Vista and Peardale. Fruit was king in the area for about 100-years. Orchards growing pears, plums, peaches and apples were everywhere. Because water was not abundant, dry farming techniques were mastered which improved fruit color. In 1915, local Bartlett pears were honored at the Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco. As the 20th century progressed, pear blight appeared, causing some growers to switch to other crops.",-120.966,39.1452

Historic Landmarks,Glenbrook Basin,"Sutton Way, south of Brunswick Rd, next to bus shelter in Glenbrook Plaza parking lot",,,,,,"Early In the 1850's Glenbrook Basin first became known as the site of county fairs, horse racing and other special events. When Olympia Park, located at the south end of the basin, opened in 1901, Glenbrook Basin became the recreational center of Nevada County and much of Northern California, and remained so for over fifty years. People would come to the basin by horse and buggy or later the automobile, but those wishing for a little more excitement would often use the Nevada County Traction Company’s trolley, or the Nevada County Narrow Gauge Railroad. The large grandstands of the three-quarter-mile racetrack stood near the junction of present Brunswick Road and Sutton Way. Trotting, pacing, and running horse races were held at the track, and motor car races began in 1913. The racetrack was one of the first electrically lighted racetracks in the state. A dam was constructed just northeast of the existing electrical substation to form Lake Olympia. The lake soon became one of the BasinÍs main attractions. Located in the center of Lake Olympia was an island with a pavilion which had a coil-spring-mounted dance floor that swayed with the rhythm of the dancers' feet. There was swimming, boating and fishing in Lake Olympia, and during some winters there was ice skating. There were boats and bathing suits for rent, and the park contained a bathhouse, a roller skating rink, and a bar. Many a romance blossomed on the lake during an evening boat ride under the stars. Families rented cabins and picnicked in the shade of the large pine trees along the shores of Lake Olympia. Olympia Park was the site of high school commencements, football and baseball games, and special events such as fat ladies' races and freckled-face children contests. The annual miners' picnics were held at the park with mucking and drilling contests, tug-of-wars and Cornish wrestling, as refreshments of various kinds flowed freely. Olympia Park fell into disrepair in the 1950s and ceased operation in 1958.

The North Bloomfield Mining Company purchased approximately 1500 acres near the settlement of Malakoff in 1866. Hydraulic mining exposed the area to enormous amounts of high pressure water through nozzles called 'monitors.' The application of pressurized water on the mountainsides of Malakoff left a 1600 acre pit 7000 feet long by 3000 feet wide. The awesome effects of the world’s largest hydraulic gold mining operation are still visible today.

These courageous pioneers were the first emigrants to take wagons over the Sierra Nevada, opening the Truckee Route of the California Trail. The Murphy, Townsend, Miller, and Hitchcock families formed the main groups of the party. Caleb Greenwood was the hired guide, and Elisha Stephens was elected Captain of the wagon train. After following the Oregon Trail to Fort Hall, Idaho, they turned away from the well-worn path and headed west into the unfamiliar Nevada desert. A Paiute Indian Chief showed them how to reach a river flowing from the Sierra Nevada, which they named 'Truckee' in his honor. Overcoming severe conditions, they followed the Truckee River to the base of the Sierra. Six members, on horseback, continued to follow the Truckee River and eventually arrived safely at Sutter's New Helvetia on December 10, 1844. Six of the wagons were left in the charge of two men, and young Moses Schallenberger, near Truckee Lake (present Donner Lake). Near this spot, with two feet of snow on the ground, they worked the remaining five wagons across the summit of the mighty Sierra Nevada on November 25, 1844. Deepening snow forced them to camp near Big Bend, on the South Yuba River. Leaving the wagons with two men and the women and children, the remaining 17 men continued on to New Helvetia to seek help. Somehow, John Sutter persuaded the men to enlist in his forces taking part in a Mexican civil war.

The George and Jacob Donner families, their teamsters, and fellow travelers suffered extreme hardship and starvation. They spent the winter here cut off from the rest of their party who camped at Donner Lake. Only eleven survived the ordeal. Their survival, against desperate odds, stands as a testament to the enduring pioneer spirit that helped shape the future of California.Second plaque dedicated 1996 by Chap 3691 E Clampus Vitus: They gave unselfishly, their fortunes and their lives that their children should survive. Near this site, in the winter of 1846, two pioneer women gave up their lives for their families. Tamsen and Elizabeth Donner feared their many children could not survive the ravages of cold and starvation when the party was caught in an early blizzard. They provided care and comfort to their families and companions throughout the snowbound winter, desperately trying to prevent the death of their loved ones. Both lost their lives. However, most of their children survived to carry their mothers' dreams of new life and new beginnings to the valleys of California. The summit that they never crossed now bears the family name. An inspiration to all who followed their footsteps across the Sierra Nevada Mountains, we herein honor the memory and the sacrifices of these women. Their struggle to survive, enduring hardships we can barely imagine, remains a legacy of the pioneer spirit.
