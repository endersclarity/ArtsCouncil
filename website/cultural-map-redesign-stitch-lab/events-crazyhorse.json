Grease, Grit and Grime has been a longtime, local institution for anyone who loves the blues. They like to call it “Dirty Blues” but it goes down smooth like a mint julep on a sunny afternoon. When it comes to the sultry, dance-inducing side of the blues equation, you can be sure they have that covered. Harp maestro Scott Hickman leads the charge.",
