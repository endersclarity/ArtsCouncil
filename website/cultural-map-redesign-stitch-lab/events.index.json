Twenty student choreographers have created dances in a variety of styles, taught to their peers in after-school and weekend rehearsals. Junior Tabby Gillespie is choreographing for the first time this year, and she chose “Benny and the Jets” by Elton John. Reflecting on her song choice, Gillespie said, “I want to share a positive vibe with the audience, conveying that dance doesn’t need to be taken so seriously. I wanted to choreograph this piece because dance has always been a place where I can be myself and has shaped me as a person.” Senior Eryn Miller has been in the Advanced Dance class for all four years of high school, and this is her third year choreographing for Showcase. This year, she is choreographing two dances: one for the intermediate class and one for a group of her advanced peers. Her advanced piece is a tribute to her grandmother, who passed away a few years ago. She titled her piece, “For Grammy,” explaining, “I will forever know the love she felt for my dancing and the pride she felt when I stepped on stage. I dance not just for myself, but to feel the everlasting love she had for my dance. I know she would be proud of the young dancer I am becoming. I want to honor her memory and give thanks to who she was.” Junior Charlotte des Tombe composed an original song for her dance, combining her love for dance as well as songwriting. Her piece explores the theme of coping with loss, and she titled her song as well as her dance “Blue Eyes.” Senior Advanced Dancer and Theatrical Dance Club President, Annie Armstrong, choreographed two dances for this show: one for a Beginning Dance class, and one for Advanced. Both of her dances reflect her transition from childhood to adulthood and her experiences over the past four years in the NU Dance Program. In her choreography proposal, Armstrong wrote, “This program has been like a home to me, and I am grateful for my friends and the connections I have made here.” This annual production is an audience favorite. It began as a senior project twenty-four years ago, when current dance teacher, Courtney Wadman, was a senior in the advanced dance class. Wadman, along with some of her fellow dancers, wanted to create a production of student works, so under the guidance of their teacher Yelena Holt, the Student Choreography Showcase became an annual tradition. Tickets are $15 and all seating is reserved. Tickets can be purchased online at www.nevadauniondance.com…. Online sales close at 10:00 a.m. the morning of the performance to prepare the box office.

He composed and produced the greatest hits of the group such as “Bamboleo”or “Djobi Djoba”.Undisputed masters of gypsy music, the group has sold over 20 million albums worldwide and has been awarded numerous gold, platinum and diamond discs, a music victory in 1990 and a Grammy Award in 2013 in the Best World Music category for the album “Savor Flamenco”. He also collaborated on the film “The Big Lebowski”by remixing “Hotel California”, and on “Toy Story III”, the Disney Pixar animated film with “You’ve Got a Friend in Me”.Most recently Tonino was awarded a platinum record for his duet with Takagi Ketra and a triple platinum record with “Ingobernable”in a duet with Tangana.He has performed in the most prestigious concert halls around the world: Radio City in New York, the Hollywood Bowl or the Greek Theater in Los Angeles, but also the Royal Albert Hall in London or the Olympia in Paris. Tonino said in an interview “We started in Saint Tropez with our guitars and since then, we have travelled around the world. Music has no borders and our music is universal”. This must be the secret to 30 years of success: an eternity in the world of music. If the story written by the Gipsy Kings and Tonino Baliardo draws its sources from the gypsy tradition, it is resolutely geared towards the future and targets all generations.Family and transmission are essential values in the eyes of Tonino who has been accompanied by his two sons Mikaël and Cosso Baliardo since 2014.Today, he continues to travel the world to share a music which is unique to him.","matched_asset_idx":542,"match_method":"name_city_fuzzy","match_confidence":"low","match_status":"mapped","is_unmatched":false,"event_category":"Performance Spaces","event_categories":["Performance Spaces"]},{"event_id":"trumba-196757559","title":"Mobilize | Art Inspiring Activism with Wild & Scenic Film Festival Exhibition","start_iso":"2026-03-19T08:00:00-07:00","end_iso":"2026-03-19T17:00:00-07:00","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","venue_name":"Eric Rood Center","source_type":"feed","source_ref":"https://www.trumba.com/calendars/nevada-county-arts-council.rss","last_verified_at":"2026-02-09T00:34:53-08:00","venue_city":"Nevada City","ticket_url":"https://www.nevadacountyarts.org/happening-now-blog/mobilize","tags":["Art & Gallery","Visual Arts"],"image_url":"https://www.trumba.com/i/DgCX2vrEpel-8aNzWE5b8cFb.jpg?w=900","description":"Mobilize is the first exhibition of 2026 under Art in Public Spaces and celebrates a 15-year partnership between Nevada County Arts Council and Wild & Scenic Film Festival.
