Tighten letter-spacing slightly for a bold editorial feel.\n\nSection headings (e.g., “Discover by Story”): 28–32px, consistent weight; avoid mixing serif/sans-serif arbitrarily—choose one family for display, one for body.\n\nBody and labels\n\nBody copy: 16–18px with 1.5–1.6 line-height for readability; keep max line width around 70–80 characters.\n\nButtons and pills: 14–16px, single line, Title Case; avoid ultra-tight tracking so labels don’t feel cramped.\n\nSpacing\n\nIncrease vertical spacing between hero headline, buttons, and the tab row (e.g., 16–24px each) to create clearer bands.\n\nStandardize outer page margins (e.g., 80–96px left/right on large desktop, 40–48px on tablet), and align all modules to this grid.\n\nEnsure consistent gap between pill rows (e.g., 12–16px) and between story cards (e.g., 24px), so the layout breathes and feels intentional.\n\nColor and contrast corrections\n\nGlobal contrast\n\nEnsure headline and primary button text meet WCAG contrast guidelines against the hero background; use a dark-to-transparent gradient behind text if photography varies.\n\nLighten or warm the hero imagery slightly so the page feels bright and inviting rather than muted and moody.\n\nBrand + accent colors\n\nMake the primary accent (e.g., the orange used on “Culture - Discovery - 2026”) brighter and more saturated, and use it consistently for: active tabs, primary buttons, key icons, and story category tags.\n\nUse a softer neutral (off-white or very light gray) as the background for the right panel and for sections below the fold to create contrast between content zones.\n\nButtons and pills\n\nPrimary button: solid accent fill with white text; hover state slightly darker shade.\n\nSecondary button: white fill with accent border/text, hover with faint tinted background.\n\nPills: use a light tinted background with darker text for inactive state; for active/selected pills, flip to solid accent with white text so selection state is unmistakable.\n\nMobile adaptation recommendations\n\nInformation hierarchy\n\nStack in this order: logo + primary nav, hero headline, short intro, primary “Explore Map” button, secondary “Browse Stories” button, then a horizontal scroll row of top categories.\n\nHide secondary navigation items behind a hamburger; keep “Map” and “Stories” as the top-level visible options.\n\nLayout and interactions\n\nConvert the right-hand filter rail into a swipeable carousel of pill groups, each group labeled by its tab (Categories, Routes, Events).\n\nMake story cards full-width vertical cards with large imagery and clear tap targets (min 44px height for any touchable element).\n\nProvide a fixed bottom bar when the user is in the map view with core actions: “Filters,” “Near Me,” “List View,” and “Story View.”\n\nTypography and spacing\n\nReduce H1 to around 28–32px on mobile while maintaining strong weight; maintain generous line-height so it doesn’t feel jammed.\n\nIncrease vertical padding between sections (24–32px) so the scroll feels intentional and editorial, not cramped.\n\nConcise implementation checklist (HTML/CSS)\n\nHTML structure\n\nWrap hero content in a <header class=\"hero\"> with child elements: .hero-media, .hero-content, .hero-actions, .hero-tabs.\n\nImplement tabs as semantic <button role=\"tab\"> elements within a <div role=\"tablist\">, with ARIA attributes for active state.\n\nUse <section> blocks for “Stories,” “This Week on the Map,” and other major sections, each with an <h2>.\n\nRepresent category filters as <button class=\"pill\"> elements inside a grid container.\n\nCSS layout\n\nUse CSS Grid or flexbox for the hero: grid-template-columns: minmax(0, 2fr) minmax(0, 1.4fr); on desktop, stacking columns on smaller screens via media queries.\n\nApply a consistent spacing scale (e.g., 4/8/12/16/24/32px) and use CSS custom properties (--space-1, --space-2, etc.) to keep spacing consistent.\n\nDefine responsive breakpoints, e.g., @media (max-width: 1024px) for tablet and @media (max-width: 768px) for mobile, to stack layout and adjust typography.\n\nCSS typography and color\n\nSet root font: html { font-size: 16px; } body { font-family: system-ui or chosen sans; line-height: 1.5; }.\n\nCreate utility classes for headings: .h1, .h2, .eyebrow with consistent sizes and weights; apply margin-bottom spacing via these classes instead of per-instance tweaks.\n\nDefine color variables: --color-bg, --color-surface, --color-accent, --color-text, --color-muted, and apply them systematically for backgrounds, text, and borders.\n\nAdd gradient overlay class for hero text legibility: .hero-overlay { background: linear-gradient(180deg, rgba(0,0,0,0.55), rgba(0,0,0,0)); }.\n\nInteraction and states\n\nImplement hover/focus states for buttons, tabs, and pills with :hover, :focus-visible, and :active styles; ensure focus outlines are visible and meet contrast requirements.\n\nAdd smooth transitions for color and background changes (transition: background-color 150ms ease, color 150ms ease;) to reinforce the contemporary, polished feel.\n\n\n\n\nAsk a follow-up\nModel"
