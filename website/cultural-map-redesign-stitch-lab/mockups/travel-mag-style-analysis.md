# Travel Mag Style Analysis (for GVNC Layout Overhaul)

## Core Pattern (from captured Creative Market references)
- Cover-first hierarchy: one dominant visual field plus a strong title lockup.
- Companion panel: clear table-of-contents style module with high-contrast color block.
- Modular spread rhythm: alternating wide feature modules and narrow supporting modules.
- Editorial pacing: big visual interruption, then denser informational areas.

## Visual Traits Worth Keeping
- High-contrast display typography (uppercase, compressed rhythm).
- Distinct accent color blocks (cyan/yellow/coral families) used sparingly.
- Clean rectangular geometry with light rounding, not soft neumorphism.
- Strong section boundaries via subtle strokes and panel shadows.

## Traits to Avoid
- Over-reliance on mountain/lake imagery as identity.
- Decorative style motifs with weak information hierarchy.
- Homogeneous card treatment where everything has equal visual weight.

## Application to Cultural Map
- Hero becomes a cover module: editorial proposition + one dominant image.
- Discovery tabs behave like “contents navigation” not generic chips.
- Map occupies a full spread module with side rails for event/editorial context.
- Directory appears as the index section, visually distinct from narrative modules.
