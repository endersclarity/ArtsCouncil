The promise of a new life emerges when Barry inadvertently attracts the affection of a mysterious woman named Lena (Emily Watson), but their budding relationship is threatened when he falls prey to the swindling operator of a phone sex line and her deranged boss (played with maniacal brio by Philip Seymour Hoffman). Fueled by the careening momentum of a baroque-futurist score by Jon Brion, the Cannes-award-winning PUNCH-DRUNK LOVE channels the spirit of classic Hollywood and the whimsy of Jacques Tati into an idiosyncratic ode to the delirium of new romance.",

      "description": "Nevada Union High School’s Theatrical Dance program proudly presents the 25th annual Student Choreography Showcase on Thursday, February 19th through Saturday, February 21st at 7:00 p.m. at the Don Baggett Theater, 11761 Ridge Road, Grass Valley. Twenty student choreographers have created dances in a variety of styles, taught to their peers in after-school and weekend rehearsals. Junior Tabby Gillespie is choreographing for the first time this year, and she chose “Benny and the Jets” by Elton John. Reflecting on her song choice, Gillespie said, “I want to share a positive vibe with the audience, conveying that dance doesn’t need to be taken so seriously. I wanted to choreograph this piece because dance has always been a place where I can be myself and has shaped me as a person.” Senior Eryn Miller has been in the Advanced Dance class for all four years of high school, and this is her third year choreographing for Showcase. This year, she is choreographing two dances: one for the intermediate class and one for a group of her advanced peers. Her advanced piece is a tribute to her grandmother, who passed away a few years ago. She titled her piece, “For Grammy,” explaining, “I will forever know the love she felt for my dancing and the pride she felt when I stepped on stage. I dance not just for myself, but to feel the everlasting love she had for my dance. I know she would be proud of the young dancer I am becoming. I want to honor her memory and give thanks to who she was.” Junior Charlotte des Tombe composed an original song for her dance, combining her love for dance as well as songwriting. Her piece explores the theme of coping with loss, and she titled her song as well as her dance “Blue Eyes.” Senior Advanced Dancer and Theatrical Dance Club President, Annie Armstrong, choreographed two dances for this show: one for a Beginning Dance class, and one for Advanced. Both of her dances reflect her transition from childhood to adulthood and her experiences over the past four years in the NU Dance Program. In her choreography proposal, Armstrong wrote, “This program has been like a home to me, and I am grateful for my friends and the connections I have made here.” This annual production is an audience favorite. It began as a senior project twenty-four years ago, when current dance teacher, Courtney Wadman, was a senior in the advanced dance class.

      "description": "Nevada Union High School’s Theatrical Dance program proudly presents the 25th annual Student Choreography Showcase on Thursday, February 19th through Saturday, February 21st at 7:00 p.m. at the Don Baggett Theater, 11761 Ridge Road, Grass Valley. Twenty student choreographers have created dances in a variety of styles, taught to their peers in after-school and weekend rehearsals. Junior Tabby Gillespie is choreographing for the first time this year, and she chose “Benny and the Jets” by Elton John. Reflecting on her song choice, Gillespie said, “I want to share a positive vibe with the audience, conveying that dance doesn’t need to be taken so seriously. I wanted to choreograph this piece because dance has always been a place where I can be myself and has shaped me as a person.” Senior Eryn Miller has been in the Advanced Dance class for all four years of high school, and this is her third year choreographing for Showcase. This year, she is choreographing two dances: one for the intermediate class and one for a group of her advanced peers. Her advanced piece is a tribute to her grandmother, who passed away a few years ago. She titled her piece, “For Grammy,” explaining, “I will forever know the love she felt for my dancing and the pride she felt when I stepped on stage. I dance not just for myself, but to feel the everlasting love she had for my dance. I know she would be proud of the young dancer I am becoming. I want to honor her memory and give thanks to who she was.” Junior Charlotte des Tombe composed an original song for her dance, combining her love for dance as well as songwriting. Her piece explores the theme of coping with loss, and she titled her song as well as her dance “Blue Eyes.” Senior Advanced Dancer and Theatrical Dance Club President, Annie Armstrong, choreographed two dances for this show: one for a Beginning Dance class, and one for Advanced. Both of her dances reflect her transition from childhood to adulthood and her experiences over the past four years in the NU Dance Program. In her choreography proposal, Armstrong wrote, “This program has been like a home to me, and I am grateful for my friends and the connections I have made here.” This annual production is an audience favorite. It began as a senior project twenty-four years ago, when current dance teacher, Courtney Wadman, was a senior in the advanced dance class. Wadman, along with some of her fellow dancers, wanted to create a production of student works, so under the guidance of their teacher Yelena Holt, the Student Choreography Showcase became an annual tradition.

      "description": "Nevada Union High School’s Theatrical Dance program proudly presents the 25th annual Student Choreography Showcase on Thursday, February 19th through Saturday, February 21st at 7:00 p.m. at the Don Baggett Theater, 11761 Ridge Road, Grass Valley. Twenty student choreographers have created dances in a variety of styles, taught to their peers in after-school and weekend rehearsals. Junior Tabby Gillespie is choreographing for the first time this year, and she chose “Benny and the Jets” by Elton John. Reflecting on her song choice, Gillespie said, “I want to share a positive vibe with the audience, conveying that dance doesn’t need to be taken so seriously. I wanted to choreograph this piece because dance has always been a place where I can be myself and has shaped me as a person.” Senior Eryn Miller has been in the Advanced Dance class for all four years of high school, and this is her third year choreographing for Showcase. This year, she is choreographing two dances: one for the intermediate class and one for a group of her advanced peers. Her advanced piece is a tribute to her grandmother, who passed away a few years ago. She titled her piece, “For Grammy,” explaining, “I will forever know the love she felt for my dancing and the pride she felt when I stepped on stage. I dance not just for myself, but to feel the everlasting love she had for my dance. I know she would be proud of the young dancer I am becoming. I want to honor her memory and give thanks to who she was.” Junior Charlotte des Tombe composed an original song for her dance, combining her love for dance as well as songwriting. Her piece explores the theme of coping with loss, and she titled her song as well as her dance “Blue Eyes.” Senior Advanced Dancer and Theatrical Dance Club President, Annie Armstrong, choreographed two dances for this show: one for a Beginning Dance class, and one for Advanced. Both of her dances reflect her transition from childhood to adulthood and her experiences over the past four years in the NU Dance Program. In her choreography proposal, Armstrong wrote, “This program has been like a home to me, and I am grateful for my friends and the connections I have made here.” This annual production is an audience favorite. It began as a senior project twenty-four years ago, when current dance teacher, Courtney Wadman, was a senior in the advanced dance class. Wadman, along with some of her fellow dancers, wanted to create a production of student works, so under the guidance of their teacher Yelena Holt, the Student Choreography Showcase became an annual tradition. Tickets are $15 and all seating is reserved. Tickets can be purchased online at www.nevadauniondance.com…. Online sales close at 10:00 a.m. the morning of the performance to prepare the box office. Remaining tickets will be sold at the box office, cash or check only, beginning 2 hours before each performance.

Known for her sharp lyrics and heartfelt delivery, she’s been praised by The New York Times for her “droll, observant and unsparing tone,” and hailed by Rolling Stone as “devastatingly great.”, On stage, Edwards channels the grit of Lucinda Williams, the candor of Brandi Carlile, and the poetic edge of Jason Isbell. With multiple JUNO and Americana Award nominations and the SOCAN Songwriting Prize to her name, she’s a storyteller whose songs hit deep - intimate, raw, and irresistibly alive.",

Whether playwriting is new to you or you're already an accomplished playwright, come join this on-going bi-weekly writers' group. We'll spend our time focusing on our writing, but with that magical element of doing so within the presence of others. Come discover the amazing experience of writing within the context of a group. Bring your computer, notebook, iPad, or whatever you like to use for writing. We share resources, discuss our goals and challenges, even provide feedback, but the primary focus of the group is to work on your own play! We'll do a check-in/discussion at the beginning of the meeting, then write in silence, and check-out at the end of our session. Contact Kimberly for the location and to answer any questions you may have.",

The film has had a tumultuous history: it was subjected to cuts after the violent response of the audience at its 1939 premiere, and the original negative was destroyed during World War II; it wasn’t reconstructed until 1959. That version, which has stunned viewers for decades, will be presented at the Onyx Downtown on March 15th! IN FRENCH W/ ENGLISH SUBTITLES",

He composed and produced the greatest hits of the group such as “Bamboleo”or “Djobi Djoba”.Undisputed masters of gypsy music, the group has sold over 20 million albums worldwide and has been awarded numerous gold, platinum and diamond discs, a music victory in 1990 and a Grammy Award in 2013 in the Best World Music category for the album “Savor Flamenco”. He also collaborated on the film “The Big Lebowski”by remixing “Hotel California”, and on “Toy Story III”, the Disney Pixar animated film with “You’ve Got a Friend in Me”.Most recently Tonino was awarded a platinum record for his duet with Takagi Ketra and a triple platinum record with “Ingobernable”in a duet with Tangana.He has performed in the most prestigious concert halls around the world: Radio City in New York, the Hollywood Bowl or the Greek Theater in Los Angeles, but also the Royal Albert Hall in London or the Olympia in Paris. Tonino said in an interview “We started in Saint Tropez with our guitars and since then, we have travelled around the world. Music has no borders and our music is universal”. This must be the secret to 30 years of success: an eternity in the world of music. If the story written by the Gipsy Kings and Tonino Baliardo draws its sources from the gypsy tradition, it is resolutely geared towards the future and targets all generations.Family and transmission are essential values in the eyes of Tonino who has been accompanied by his two sons Mikaël and Cosso Baliardo since 2014.Today, he continues to travel the world to share a music which is unique to him.",

      "description": "Sent upon request. (We meet in each other's homes.) All playwrights welcome! Whether playwriting is new to you or you're already an accomplished playwright, come join this on-going bi-weekly writers' group. We'll spend our time focusing on our writing, but with that magical element of doing so within the presence of others. Come discover the amazing experience of writing within the context of a group. Bring your computer, notebook, iPad, or whatever you like to use for writing. We share resources, discuss our goals and challenges, even provide feedback, but the primary focus of the group is to work on your own play! We'll do a check-in/discussion at the beginning of the meeting, then write in silence, and check-out at the end of our session. Contact Kimberly for the location and to answer any questions you may have.",
