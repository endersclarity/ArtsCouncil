    "description": "Nevada Union High School’s Theatrical Dance program proudly presents the 25th annual Student Choreography Showcase on Thursday, February 19th through Saturday, February 21st at 7:00 p.m. at the Don Baggett Theater, 11761 Ridge Road, Grass Valley. Twenty student choreographers have created dances in a variety of styles, taught to their peers in after-school and weekend rehearsals. Junior Tabby Gillespie is choreographing for the first time this year, and she chose “Benny and the Jets” by Elton John. Reflecting on her song choice, Gillespie said, “I want to share a positive vibe with the audience, conveying that dance doesn’t need to be taken so seriously. I wanted to choreograph this piece because dance has always been a place where I can be myself and has shaped me as a person.” Senior Eryn Miller has been in the Advanced Dance class for all four years of high school, and this is her third year choreographing for Showcase. This year, she is choreographing two dances: one for the intermediate class and one for a group of her advanced peers. Her advanced piece is a tribute to her grandmother, who passed away a few years ago. She titled her piece, “For Grammy,” explaining, “I will forever know the love she felt for my dancing and the pride she felt when I stepped on stage. I dance not just for myself, but to feel the everlasting love she had for my dance. I know she would be proud of the young dancer I am becoming. I want to honor her memory and give thanks to who she was.” Junior Charlotte des Tombe composed an original song for her dance, combining her love for dance as well as songwriting. Her piece explores the theme of coping with loss, and she titled her song as well as her dance “Blue Eyes.” Senior Advanced Dancer and Theatrical Dance Club President, Annie Armstrong, choreographed two dances for this show: one for a Beginning Dance class, and one for Advanced. Both of her dances reflect her transition from childhood to adulthood and her experiences over the past four years in the NU Dance Program. In her choreography proposal, Armstrong wrote, “This program has been like a home to me, and I am grateful for my friends and the connections I have made here.” This annual production is an audience favorite. It began as a senior project twenty-four years ago, when current dance teacher, Courtney Wadman, was a senior in the advanced dance class. Wadman, along with some of her fellow dancers, wanted to create a production of student works, so under the guidance of their teacher Yelena Holt, the Student Choreography Showcase became an annual tradition. Tickets are $15 and all seating is reserved. Tickets can be purchased online at www.nevadauniondance.com…. Online sales close at 10:00 a.m. the morning of the performance to prepare the box office. Remaining tickets will be sold at the box office, cash or check only, beginning 2 hours before each performance.

    "description": "Nevada Union High School’s Theatrical Dance program proudly presents the 25th annual Student Choreography Showcase on Thursday, February 19th through Saturday, February 21st at 7:00 p.m. at the Don Baggett Theater, 11761 Ridge Road, Grass Valley. Twenty student choreographers have created dances in a variety of styles, taught to their peers in after-school and weekend rehearsals. Junior Tabby Gillespie is choreographing for the first time this year, and she chose “Benny and the Jets” by Elton John. Reflecting on her song choice, Gillespie said, “I want to share a positive vibe with the audience, conveying that dance doesn’t need to be taken so seriously. I wanted to choreograph this piece because dance has always been a place where I can be myself and has shaped me as a person.” Senior Eryn Miller has been in the Advanced Dance class for all four years of high school, and this is her third year choreographing for Showcase. This year, she is choreographing two dances: one for the intermediate class and one for a group of her advanced peers. Her advanced piece is a tribute to her grandmother, who passed away a few years ago. She titled her piece, “For Grammy,” explaining, “I will forever know the love she felt for my dancing and the pride she felt when I stepped on stage. I dance not just for myself, but to feel the everlasting love she had for my dance. I know she would be proud of the young dancer I am becoming. I want to honor her memory and give thanks to who she was.” Junior Charlotte des Tombe composed an original song for her dance, combining her love for dance as well as songwriting. Her piece explores the theme of coping with loss, and she titled her song as well as her dance “Blue Eyes.” Senior Advanced Dancer and Theatrical Dance Club President, Annie Armstrong, choreographed two dances for this show: one for a Beginning Dance class, and one for Advanced. Both of her dances reflect her transition from childhood to adulthood and her experiences over the past four years in the NU Dance Program. In her choreography proposal, Armstrong wrote, “This program has been like a home to me, and I am grateful for my friends and the connections I have made here.” This annual production is an audience favorite. It began as a senior project twenty-four years ago, when current dance teacher, Courtney Wadman, was a senior in the advanced dance class. Wadman, along with some of her fellow dancers, wanted to create a production of student works, so under the guidance of their teacher Yelena Holt, the Student Choreography Showcase became an annual tradition. Tickets are $15 and all seating is reserved. Tickets can be purchased online at www.nevadauniondance.com…. Online sales close at 10:00 a.m. the morning of the performance to prepare the box office. Remaining tickets will be sold at the box office, cash or check only, beginning 2 hours before each performance. For additional information, contact the Nevada Union Dance Department at (530) 273-4431 ext. 2103 or email nuhsdance@gmail.com.",

    "description": "Nevada Union High School’s Theatrical Dance program proudly presents the 25th annual Student Choreography Showcase on Thursday, February 19th through Saturday, February 21st at 7:00 p.m. at the Don Baggett Theater, 11761 Ridge Road, Grass Valley. Twenty student choreographers have created dances in a variety of styles, taught to their peers in after-school and weekend rehearsals. Junior Tabby Gillespie is choreographing for the first time this year, and she chose “Benny and the Jets” by Elton John. Reflecting on her song choice, Gillespie said, “I want to share a positive vibe with the audience, conveying that dance doesn’t need to be taken so seriously. I wanted to choreograph this piece because dance has always been a place where I can be myself and has shaped me as a person.” Senior Eryn Miller has been in the Advanced Dance class for all four years of high school, and this is her third year choreographing for Showcase. This year, she is choreographing two dances: one for the intermediate class and one for a group of her advanced peers. Her advanced piece is a tribute to her grandmother, who passed away a few years ago. She titled her piece, “For Grammy,” explaining, “I will forever know the love she felt for my dancing and the pride she felt when I stepped on stage. I dance not just for myself, but to feel the everlasting love she had for my dance. I know she would be proud of the young dancer I am becoming. I want to honor her memory and give thanks to who she was.” Junior Charlotte des Tombe composed an original song for her dance, combining her love for dance as well as songwriting. Her piece explores the theme of coping with loss, and she titled her song as well as her dance “Blue Eyes.” Senior Advanced Dancer and Theatrical Dance Club President, Annie Armstrong, choreographed two dances for this show: one for a Beginning Dance class, and one for Advanced. Both of her dances reflect her transition from childhood to adulthood and her experiences over the past four years in the NU Dance Program. In her choreography proposal, Armstrong wrote, “This program has been like a home to me, and I am grateful for my friends and the connections I have made here.” This annual production is an audience favorite. It began as a senior project twenty-four years ago, when current dance teacher, Courtney Wadman, was a senior in the advanced dance class. Wadman, along with some of her fellow dancers, wanted to create a production of student works, so under the guidance of their teacher Yelena Holt, the Student Choreography Showcase became an annual tradition. Tickets are $15 and all seating is reserved. Tickets can be purchased online at www.nevadauniondance.com…. Online sales close at 10:00 a.m. the morning of the performance to prepare the box office. Remaining tickets will be sold at the box office, cash or check only, beginning 2 hours before each performance. For additional information, contact the Nevada Union Dance Department at (530) 273-4431 ext. 2103 or email nuhsdance@gmail.com.",

    "description": "Sent upon request. (We meet in each other's homes.) All playwrights welcome! Whether playwriting is new to you or you're already an accomplished playwright, come join this on-going bi-weekly writers' group. We'll spend our time focusing on our writing, but with that magical element of doing so within the presence of others. Come discover the amazing experience of writing within the context of a group. Bring your computer, notebook, iPad, or whatever you like to use for writing. We share resources, discuss our goals and challenges, even provide feedback, but the primary focus of the group is to work on your own play! We'll do a check-in/discussion at the beginning of the meeting, then write in silence, and check-out at the end of our session. Contact Kimberly for the location and to answer any questions you may have.",
