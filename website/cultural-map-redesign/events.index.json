In this lively, interactive Zoom presentation, the Maestro​ (MIM Artistic Director Ryan Murray) pulls back the curtain on one of the most dynamic and emotionally powerful art forms ever created. Tracing opera’s evolution from the 1600s to today, participants will explore how opera has continually reinvented itself across centuries, styles, and cultures., Far from being elitist, opera was originally the people’s art—an immersive blend of orchestra, voice, drama, design, and storytelling. Through highlights of essential works, engaging commentary, and audience Q&A, attendees will gain practical tools to explore opera on their own and discover what resonates with them. No prior musical experience is required—just curiosity. Whether you’re brand new to opera or simply want a fresh perspective, this welcoming, plain language session offers an ideal access point into a vast and thrilling corner of the classical repertoire., Ryan Murray is the Artistic Director of Music in the Mountains, Music Director of the Auburn Symphony, Principal Pops Conductor of the Modesto Symphony and he is the Director of Orchestra and Opera at California State University Sacramento, and conducts the Sacramento Youth Symphony.
