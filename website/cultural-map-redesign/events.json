No prior musical experience is required—just curiosity. Whether you’re brand new to opera or simply want a fresh perspective, this welcoming, plain language session offers an ideal access point into a vast and thrilling corner of the classical repertoire., Ryan Murray is the Artistic Director of Music in the Mountains, Music Director of the Auburn Symphony, Principal Pops Conductor of the Modesto Symphony and he is the Director of Orchestra and Opera at California State University Sacramento, and conducts the Sacramento Youth Symphony. An award-winning opera conductor, Ryan is the past Music Director of Opera Modesto and Fresno Grand Opera., , Ryan was the winner of the Vienna Philharmonic’s prestigious Ansbacher Fellowship for Young Conductors and was awarded second place in the 2019 American Prize for Orchestral Conducting; he garnered national recognition for his performances of contemporary opera as the winner of the 2017 American Prize in Opera."
