    "description": "Sent upon request. (We meet in each other's homes.) All playwrights welcome! Whether playwriting is new to you or you're already an accomplished playwright, come join this on-going bi-weekly writers' group. We'll spend our time focusing on our writing, but with that magical element of doing so within the presence of others. Come discover the amazing experience of writing within the context of a group. Bring your computer, notebook, iPad, or whatever you like to use for writing. We share resources, discuss our goals and challenges, even provide feedback, but the primary focus of the group is to work on your own play! We'll do a check-in/discussion at the beginning of the meeting, then write in silence, and check-out at the end of our session. Contact Kimberly for the location and to answer any questions you may have."

    "description": "THE RULES OF THE GAME is a scathing critique of corrupt French society cloaked in a comedy of manners, in which a weekend at a marquis’s country château lays bare some ugly truths about a group of haut-bourgeois acquaintances. The film has had a tumultuous history: it was subjected to cuts after the violent response of the audience at its 1939 premiere, and the original negative was destroyed during World War II; it wasn’t reconstructed until 1959. That version, which has stunned viewers for decades, will be presented at the Onyx Downtown on March 15th! IN FRENCH W/ ENGLISH SUBTITLES"
